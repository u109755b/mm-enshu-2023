41	So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming.
42	Then he could not tell what to do.
43	So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.
44	He went to the little Pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.
45	Then the little Pig said, "Hah!
46	I frightened you, did I?
47	I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill."
48	Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.
49	When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf.
50	And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever after.
