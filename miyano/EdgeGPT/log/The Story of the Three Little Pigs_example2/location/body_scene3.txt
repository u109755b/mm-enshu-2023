When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, "Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips." "Where?" said the little Pig. "Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner." "Very well," said the little Pig, "I will be ready. What time do you mean to go?" "Oh, at six o'clock." Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home again before six.
