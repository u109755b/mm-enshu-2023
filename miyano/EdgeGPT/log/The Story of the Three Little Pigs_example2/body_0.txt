0	Once upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune.
1	The first that went off met a Man with a bundle of straw, and said to him, "Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house"; which the Man did, and the little Pig built a house with it.
2	Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."
3	To which the Pig answered, "No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."
4	"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"
5	said the Wolf.
6	So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in, and ate up the little Pig.
7	The second Pig met a Man with a bundle of furze, and said, "Please, Man, give me that furze to build a house"; which the Man did, and the Pig built his house.
8	Then along came the Wolf and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."
9	"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."
10	"Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!"
11	So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.
12	The third little Pig met a Man with a load of bricks, and said, "Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with"; so the Man gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them.
13	So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."
14	"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."
15	"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."
16	Well, he huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he could not get the house down.
17	When he found that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said, "Little Pig, I know where there is a nice field of turnips."
18	"Where?"
