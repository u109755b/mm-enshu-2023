19	said the little Pig.
20	"Oh, in Mr. Smith's home-field; and if you will be ready to-morrow morning, I will call for you, and we will go together and get some for dinner."
21	"Very well," said the little Pig, "I will be ready.
22	What time do you mean to go?"
23	"Oh, at six o'clock."
24	Well, the little Pig got up at five, and got the turnips and was home again before six.
25	When the Wolf came he said, "Little Pig, are you ready?"
26	"Ready!"
27	said the little Pig, "I have been and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner."
28	The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, "Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree."
29	"Where?"
30	said the Pig.
31	"Down at Merry-garden," replied the Wolf; "and if you will not deceive me I will come for you, at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will go together and get some apples."
32	Well, the little Pig woke at four the next morning, and bustled up, and went off for the apples, hoping to get back before the Wolf came; but he had farther to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was coming down from it, he saw the Wolf coming, which, as you may suppose, frightened him very much.
33	When the Wolf came up he said, "Little Pig, what!
34	are you here before me?
35	Are they nice apples?"
36	"Yes, very," said the little Pig; "I will throw you down one."
37	And he threw it so far that, while the Wolf was gone to pick it up, the little Pig jumped down and ran home.
38	The next day the Wolf came again, and said to the little Pig, "Little Pig, there is a Fair in the Town this afternoon: will you go?"
39	"Oh, yes," said the Pig, "I will go; what time shall you be ready?"
40	"At three," said the Wolf.
