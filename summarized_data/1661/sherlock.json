Dr. Watson, narrating the story, recounts his reduced contact with Holmes after his own marriage and return to medical practice. One evening in March 1888, Watson visits Holmes, who deduces Watson's return to work and recent activities simply by observation. Holmes has received a mysterious letter summoning him to consult on a highly sensitive matter.   The client, who arrives wearing a mask and initially introduces himself as Count Von Kramm, soon reveals his true identity as the King of Bohemia. He seeks Holmes's help to retrieve a compromising photograph from Irene Adler, an opera singer with whom he had an affair. The photograph threatens his upcoming engagement to a Scandinavian princess and could potentially create a scandal. Despite previous attempts to recover or steal the photo, all have failed. Holmes takes on the case, and the King provides funds for any expenses. Holmes and Watson agree to discuss the matter further the following day.",
