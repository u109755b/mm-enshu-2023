The author, Lemuel Gulliver, an acquaintance of the publisher Richard Sympson, retired to Newark after growing tired of attention at his Redriff home. Gulliver hails from a Nottinghamshire family with origins in Oxfordshire. Sympson, left with Gulliver's papers, edited them for readability, removing technical nautical information in the hope the travels would entertain the nobility. Any errors due to these edits are Sympson's responsibility, and he offers the unedited work to interested readers, with further details about the author found in the book's beginning.
Captain Gulliver writes to his cousin Sympson expressing disappointment in how his travel accounts were published, with omissions and additions not authorized by him. He criticizes the failure of his book to bring about the positive societal changes he'd hoped for, despite having been promised such outcomes by Sympson. Gulliver also laments the public misconceptions and criticisms of his work, including the disbelief in the existence of the peoples and places he describes. He acknowledges a resurgence of negative traits in himself since his return and ends by renouncing further attempts to reform society.
The narrator, a well-educated and well-traveled surgeon from England, recounts his voyages and eventual shipwreck that left him stranded in Lilliput, a country inhabited by very small people. He initially sets out to sea to improve his fortunes and satisfies his interest in travel and navigation. After various voyages and some success, he decides to embark on a journey that results in a shipwreck. He swims to the shore of Lilliput and, exhausted, falls asleep. Upon waking, he finds himself captured by the tiny inhabitants who view him as a giant. Despite initial hostilities, he is treated with curiosity and caution by the Lilliputians, who provide him with food and drink and eventually plan to transport him to their capital city as a prisoner to be presented to the emperor.
The emperor of Lilliput visits the giant author, Gulliver, who has been confined and has his possessions inventoried by the tiny inhabitants. The emperor, admired by Gulliver for his regal bearing, orders him to be taught their language. Gulliver complies with a search of his belongings, showcasing the scale difference between him and the Lilliputians, and has items like his sword and pistols confiscated for safety. Despite these measures, he earns the court's favor by showing kindness to Lilliputian criminals and needs provisions arranged by the emperor to support his large size. Gulliver expresses a desire for freedom and is told it will take time and require peace between him and the kingdom.
The author impresses the emperor and nobility of Lilliput with unusual entertainment, gains favor, and learns their language. He witnesses the court's unique entertainments, including perilous rope-dancing by courtiers vying for favor or office, and a peculiar game of agility for special recognition. The author also creates a large stage for the entertainment of the emperor, performing an impressive display with the royal horses. Close to the time of his release, a large lost object, later revealed to be the author's hat, causes intrigue among the Lilliputians, and the author helps retrieve it.  Furthermore, he describes a military exercise where he stands like a colossus with the Lilliputian army marching beneath him. After numerous petitions, the emperor agrees to grant the author's freedom with certain conditions to ensure the safety and interests of the Lilliputians, dictated by his adversary Skyresh Bolgolam, but also with privileges, including sufficient daily rations. The author agrees to the stipulations and looks forward to serving the emperor loyally.
The narrator, after gaining freedom, explores Lilliput’s capital Mildendo and the emperor's palace; careful not to harm the tiny city. He later has a conversation with Reldresal, the principal secretary, about the empire's political conflicts and the war with Blefuscu. The narrator offers his services to the emperor to defend against invaders.
The protagonist employs a clever strategy to thwart an invasion from Blefuscu, earning him a prestigious title in Lilliput. He assists in negotiating peace with Blefuscu and demonstrates his strength and value to both empires. However, he inadvertently offends the Lilliputian empress by extinguishing a palace fire using his urine, leading to a pardon but also a desire for revenge from the empress.
The chapter describes the diminutive size of Lilliputians and their proportionally small animals and vegetation. The author begins by promising a treatise on the empire of Lilliput and then shares observations on the inhabitants' size, sight, and writing direction. The Lilliputians bury their dead upside down, expecting the earth to turn over. The justice system harshly punishes false accusers and rewards the wrongfully accused. Fraud is deemed worse than theft and is often punished by death. The author notes Lilliputians reward citizens observing the law for lengthy periods and their image of Justice symbolizes a preference for rewards over punishments.  Lilliputians prioritize moral character over abilities in appointments to public office, as they deem everyone capable of serving society. Denial of Divine Providence disqualifies one from public office. The author criticizes corrupt practices of gaining positions and regards ingratitude as a heinous crime. Lilliputian children are raised communally, with different practices for noble and common families, and education tailor-made for their future.  The author also mentions his adjustments living among Lilliputians, like creating large furniture for himself and employing cooks and waiters. He discusses the emperor’s curiosity about his lifestyle and an unproven scandal involving the treasurer's wife, which sours the treasurer's opinion of him. The chapter ends with the author's decline in favor due to court politics and manipulations.
The author learns of a conspiracy to charge him with high-treason and escapes to Blefuscu, where he is well-received. In Lilliput, his services to the king are overshadowed by enmity from several court figures, leading to an impeachment for extinguishing a palace fire with urine and rejecting orders to subjugate Blefuscu. The Lilliputians debate his punishment, from death to blinding, but settle on the latter. Before the sentence is executed, the author flees to Blefuscu, under pretense of the king's permission, while keeping the conspiracy against him a secret from the Blefuscudian court.
The narrator finds a boat ashore in Blefuscu, repairs it with help from the locals, and departs with permission from the Emperor of Blefuscu. Despite Lilliput's attempt to have him seized, he leaves on good terms and sets sail, eventually being picked up by an English merchant ship. After returning to England, he profits from showing off his exotic livestock, then leaves his family with a comfortable sum of money and resumes traveling on a ship bound for Surat.
Jonathan Swift's "A Voyage to Brobdingnag" continues with the protagonist leaving his homeland for a second voyage. Gulliver finds himself in a violent storm and is left stranded on the shores of Brobdingnag, a land of giants. He is discovered by a native who is a farmer and experiences various events at the farmer's house, including being viewed as a curiosity due to his small size. Despite the dangers and the shock of encountering such large creatures, Gulliver manages to communicate and express his intelligence, leading to a somewhat hospitable reception from the farmer and his family.
The narrator, a diminutive individual, is cared for by a farmer's young daughter, Glumdalclitch, who teaches him the local language and dresses him. Recognized as a peculiar creature, he is shown for money at a market by the farmer on the advice of a neighbor. Despite his initial reluctance, he performs various tricks to entertain onlookers and is well protected from harm by the farmer and his nurse. His fame spreads, leading to him being exhibited in towns and to visiting nobles at home. Eventually, the farmer decides to take him on a profitable tour to major cities, culminating in their arrival at the capital, where he continues to be displayed to the public, and his language skills improve significantly under Glumdalclitch's tutelage.
The author is taken from his farmer master to court, where the queen purchases him and he becomes a favorite, engaging in discussions with scholars and receiving care from Glumdalclitch, who is appointed as his nurse. The queen provides for him, having a special room made, and he socializes with the royal family. He experiences challenges such as an altercation with the queen’s dwarf and has to deal with large insects. Despite difficulties, he's accepted at court and takes part in various conversations, often defending his homeland.
The author offers a detailed account of a fictional country he traveled in, spanning 2,000 miles around the metropolis Lorbrulgrud, criticizing European cartographers for not including this vast land between Japan and California. The kingdom is described as a peninsula with mainly inaccessible mountains, and no seaports due to dangerous coastline conditions. They rely on riverine trade and occasionally consume beached whales but have no regular sea fishing. The author mentions 51 cities, with Lorbrulgrud being particularly large, and gives specifics about the palace. His travels include being carried around in boxes of different sizes by a trusted servant or Glumdalclitch, his nurse. He also visited the chief temple, though was unimpressed by its tower’s height compared to European structures, but noted its architectural beauty. His account also briefly touches upon the grandiosity of the king’s kitchen and the royal horse stables.
The author, in his diminished size, experiences numerous mishaps, including being knocked down by apples, assaulted by hail, carried off by a dog, and nearly abducted by birds and a monkey. He also narrowly avoids disastrous falls and encounters with large insects. Despite these dangers, he displays his skills in navigation by sailing a miniature boat, which provides entertainment for the court. The author's small stature and resulting misadventures become a source of amusement for those around him.
In Chapter VI of Gulliver’s travels, Gulliver finds ways to amuse and serve the king and queen of Brobdingnag, including making a comb from the king's beard trimmings and musical chairs from the queen's hair. Despite his size, he adapts to play music on a giant spinet for the royal court. In conversations with the king, Gulliver discusses England's government, law, and society in detail, with the king probing deeply into the functioning and morality of English institutions, often with critical observations. The king ultimately concludes that the English are a corrupt and morally bankrupt society.
The author professes his profound love for his country and attempts to present it in the best light to a foreign king, despite being ridiculed. He proposes to the king an invention of powerful explosive weaponry, but the king, appalled by the destructive nature of the invention, rejects the idea. The king's restricted worldview and lack of political sophistication are critiqued. The foreign nation's learning is limited to practical subjects, with simple laws and plain language in texts, which lack European complexity. Military structure in this country is composed of commoners led by the nobility, with a history of internal strife over power, liberty, and control, though currently kept in check by law and consensus.
The narrator accompanies the king and queen on a journey, during which he becomes seasick and Glumdalclitch falls ill. Longing for freedom and to return to England, he cleverly arranges a trip to the seashore. There, an eagle snatches up his traveling box and eventually drops it into the sea. Rescued by a passing ship, he finds himself among people of his own size and returns to England. After reuniting with his family, he finds it difficult to readjust to his normal scale of life, facing ridicule for his odd behavior before he and his family come to an understanding.
The narrator, after having recently returned home, is persuaded to join a voyage to the East Indies as a ship's surgeon by an old acquaintance, Captain William Robinson. Despite past misfortunes, his desire to see the world prevails, and he convinces his wife to agree. The voyage goes well until they are attacked by pirates, led in part by a ruthless Dutchman. Following the attack, where the narrator attempts unsuccessfully to negotiate for mercy, he is set adrift in a canoe by the pirates. Surviving through resourcefulness and encountering various islands, his situation takes an extraordinary turn when he sees a mysterious flying island inhabited by people, which approaches and rescues him after he signals for help.
The chapter describes the peculiar features, habits, and society of the Laputians, including their focus on music and mathematics to the neglect of practical matters. The narrator is surrounded by curious onlookers upon arrival, introduced to the king's court, and receives a suit of ill-fitting clothes from a tailor. Laputians are depicted as deeply absorbed in thought, requiring attendants called flappers to help them focus on conversations or prevent accidents. The king and his court appear indifferent to the narrator's experiences, focusing instead on mathematical pursuits. The Laputians fear astronomical events and their women show disregard for their husbands, preferring the company of strangers. The king moves the island as desired and it is difficult for women to leave due to the pleasures they find there, despite their longing for the mainland. The narrator learns the local language and customs, but finds the king only interested in mathematics, not other aspects of the narrator's knowledge.
The chapter describes the flying island of Laputa, controlled by magnetic forces that allow it to ascend, hover, or move to different locations above the monarch's realm. The king uses the island's movement as a means of controlling rebellions by threatening or enacting punishment from above. There is also mention of advanced astronomy by the Laputians, who have discovered celestial bodies not known to European astronomers. However, the island's abilities are limited to the extent of the kingdom, and it cannot rise beyond four miles high. An incident is recounted where the inhabitants of Lindalino rebel against the king and neutralize the island's magnetic control using their own lodestones, and they eventually negotiate their demands with the monarchy. The chapter also includes a fundamental law that prohibits the king and his heirs from leaving the island.
The author departs from Laputa, feeling neglected due to his lack of interest in mathematics and music, and travels to Balnibarbi, arriving in its capital, Lagado. He is warmly welcomed by Lord Munodi, a respected but considered simple-minded noble. They discuss European customs and Lord Munodi intercedes to secure the author's departure. He receives gifts from the king and Lord Munodi, along with a letter of recommendation.  In Lagado, he observes the dilapidated buildings and the poverty of the populace. Lord Munodi, previously a governor but removed for alleged incompetency, hosts him and explains the local situation. They visit Munodi's well-managed estate, contrasting with the surrounding poorly managed lands.  The author learns that the kingdom's adversity stems from an academy of 'projectors' in Lagado, promoting unworkable schemes to advance arts and sciences, causing widespread neglect and degradation. Munodi fears he must conform to these practices despite his skepticism and success in traditional methods.  The author is introduced to the grand academy of Lagado, full of outlandish and impractical ideas. Munodi relates a failed endeavor endorsed by the projectors to replace his efficient mill with an impractical one, costing him resources and leaving him with a damaged reputation. The author plans to visit the academy, known for its wild and unrealized projects.
The narrator visits the grand academy of Lagado, where professors engage in bizarre and impractical experiments such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, turning ice into gunpowder, and building houses from the roof down. He encounters strange inventions like a machine for writing books without knowledge, a language composed entirely of things instead of words, and a method of learning mathematics by eating wafers infused with propositions. Despite the absurdity, these professors are esteemed and continue their work, funded by the academy.
The chapter provides an account of the author's experience at a fictional academy where impractical political schemes are discussed. Some academics, considered out of touch with reality, suggest ludicrous methods to improve governance, such as medically treating senators for their political ills and encouraging the physical reminder of duties for forgetful ministers. A few ideas include contradictory voting to ensure public good and absurdly intricate ways to merge opposing political perspectives. Discussions on unusual ways to raise taxes based on personal attributes and beauty, and peculiar strategies for maintaining loyalty to the crown, are also entertained. The author offers his own observations on political plots and the manipulation of information, which is well received by one of the professors. Disenchanted with what he perceives as absurdities, the author contemplates returning to England.
The author leaves Lagado for Maldonada, contemplates visiting Luggnagg but ends up taking a shorter voyage to Glubbdubdrib upon a local gentleman's suggestion. Glubbdubdrib is governed by a tribe of magicians, where the author is received by the governor who has the power to summon the dead. During his stay, he is served by spectral attendants, interacts with historical figures summoned from the past, and reflects on his experiences before returning to the mainland.
The narrator visited Glubbdubdrib where he met famous ancients like Homer and Aristotle, noting the mismatch between their actual selves and their commentators' portrayals. He facilitated discussions with modern philosophers and critiqued the reputed actions of historical figures, drawing parallels to the corruption in his contemporary society. Many historical figures admitted to undeserving rises to power due to acts such as fraud, betrayal, and worse. The narrator lamented the decline of noble qualities in current generations compared to their virtuous ancestors, observing the degenerative effects of diseases and the abandonment of traditional values for monetary gain.
The author departs from Glubbdubdrib, waits at Maldonada, and sails to Luggnagg, enduring a storm on the way. Upon arrival, he is mistaken as a suspicious foreigner and is examined and confined until the court decides his fate. Maintained at the king's expense, he is eventually granted audience with the king, where he must adhere to strict court etiquette. The king's leniency allows him an audience without the usual unpleasantness. After three months, despite receiving favor from the king, he decides it is best to return to his family.
The chapter describes the author's interactions with the people of Luggnagg and their reactions to his views on the immortality of the Struldbrugs. The Luggnaggians are depicted as courteous, and the author becomes intrigued by the Struldbrugs, who are rare individuals born with a mark that signifies they will never die. However, their immortality turns out to be a curse rather than a blessing, as they age without the prospect of death, becoming increasingly miserable and decrepit. The author initially fantasizes about the benefits of eternal life but, after learning more about the Struldbrugs and seeing their condition, he becomes disenchanted with the idea of living forever. The laws of Luggnagg treat the Struldbrugs as dead in a legal sense upon reaching the age of 80, preventing them from accumulating excessive wealth or power. The king of Luggnagg jests about sending Struldbrugs to the author's homeland to dissuade the fear of death. The author concludes that the laws concerning Struldbrugs are sensible, given the complications their eternal life would entail.
The author departs from Luggnagg, travels to Japan, and then returns to Europe. He is granted favor by the Japanese Emperor due to his connections with the King of Luggnagg, avoiding the Christian crucifix-trampling ceremony. He joins a Dutch ship in Japan and after a fairly uneventful journey, he arrives in Amsterdam, then travels to England, reuniting with his family after over five years away.
The author, having accepted a captaincy aboard a merchant vessel, leaves his pregnant wife and sets sail, only to face mutiny by his crew who were secretly buccaneers. They confine him to his cabin, seize control of the ship, and eventually abandon him in a strange land. He encounters grotesque humanoid creatures, the Yahoos, and later meets two civilized and rational horses, the Houyhnhnms, who are shocked by his appearance but treat him with curiosity and gentleness. The author attempts to communicate with the Houyhnhnms, hoping to find safety and shelter among them.
The narrator describes being led to a Houyhnhnm's house, his reception, and his adaptation to the local diet. The house is primitive and occupied by civil-like horses performing domestic chores. After some initial confusion and fear, he is accepted by the Houyhnhnms. Struggling with the local diet of roots and raw meat, he ultimately devises a way to cook oats into a cake, which he eats with milk, learning to survive without his usual foods. He notes his health remains good despite the diet change and creates simple tools for hunting, showing his resourcefulness. The chapter conveys the narrator's surprise at the Houyhnhnms' society and his methods of coping with the unfamiliar environment.
The author is determined to learn the language of the Houyhnhnms, and his master is keen to teach him, intrigued by his human characteristics, which contrast with the typical brutish nature of Yahoos. The author works on his language skills, eventually being able to understand and communicate reasonably well. Houyhnhnms of higher status visit out of curiosity to see this peculiar creature who can speak and reason. The author's master is particularly interested in his background, including how he arrived at their land. The author explains his journey and the use of clothes to his master, who grants him privacy regarding his dressing habits. The author's progression in the language leads to an in-depth conversation in which he explains the governance of his own species and their control of technology like ships, which astonishes his master, who cannot fathom the Yahoo species being capable of such feats. The master continues to educate the author and encourages others to treat him respectfully to maintain his good humor.
The author discusses the Houyhnhnms' difficulty in comprehending falsehoods, and their disapproval of the author's views on truth and lies, largely due to their society not practicing deceit. The author describes his master's shock at learning about the treatment of horses in his homeland, considered equivalent to the Houyhnhnms in the master's land, especially practices like castrating to make them docile and using them for labor until they die. The master also finds it hard to believe that humans would ride on the back of a Houyhnhnm. The conversation shifts to the author's life story, including his career as a surgeon, his country being ruled by a queen, and details of his last voyage where he was a ship commander and had to deal with various misfortunes including the need to replace crew members with convicts and other desperate men. The master is puzzled by human vices and their consequences, leading to lengthy explanations about human societies, power, and government. The author promises to attempt explaining these complex ideas to his inquisitive master.
The author recounts his conversations with his master about the state of England and its involvement in wars, the reasons behind European conflicts, and the flawed legal system at home. He details the causes of warfare, such as the ambition of princes, religious differences, and the defense of territories. He also sarcastically comments on the justifications for war and the honorable perception of soldiers. Regarding law, he criticizes lawyers as manipulators of truth who complicate justice, and judges as biased individuals furthering legal confusion. His master regrets the misuse of human intellect in such professions.
The passage reflects on the state of England under Queen Anne, exploring the effects of money and luxuries on society. It describes how the pursuit of wealth drives people to various unsavory occupations and how English people waste resources to indulge in extravagances that lead to diseases and social ills. The author criticizes the medical profession, suggesting its remedies often worsen health, and mocks the predictive abilities of physicians. The text also comments on the corrupt practices in politics, where power and bribery prevail, and a chief minister's palace serves as a breeding ground for similar behavior. The speaker recounts his own discussions with his master about the nature of English nobility, contrasting it with his master's society and highlighting the degeneracy and corruption among English aristocrats.
The author discusses his conflicted feelings about humanity after witnessing the virtuous nature of the Houyhnhnms and the savagery of the Yahoos, which leads him to prefer the company of the former and consider staying with them permanently. He admits to softening his accounts of human flaws when describing his countrymen to his non-human master. This master makes keen observations about human nature, finding parallels between the brutish behavior of Yahoos and humans, such as greed, conflict over possessions, destructive consumption, and diseases caused by excess. He notes the differences in governance, law, and social structures between Yahoos and humans and considers the Yahoos' shared mates and lack of hygiene uniquely barbaric, though the author refrains from defending humanity against these points. The master also describes peculiar behaviors of Yahoos such as hoarding shiny stones and experiencing melancholy, seeing parallels with human avarice and spleen. Despite witnessing curious and negative behaviors among the Yahoos similar to human faults, the master does not equate the more refined vices of humans with the more instinctual vices seen in Yahoos.
The narrator, while recognizing the negative aspects of Yahoos seen by his Houyhnhnm master, seeks to observe them himself, finding them untamable, noxious, and with irritating habits. Yahoos are employed for menial tasks and live in fundamental conditions, while the Houyhnhnms, embodying virtue and reason, are devoid of evil concepts. Houyhnhnms focus on cultivating reason and friendship, maintain simple reproductive customs to prevent overpopulation, and choose marital pairs for pragmatic reasons, without romantic rituals. They educate their youth with a focus on temperance and physical prowess, and host a festival to celebrate athletic competence. Furthermore, Houyhnhnms convene every four years to discuss national matters and manage resources and population effectively.
The Houyhnhnms debated whether to exterminate the Yahoos, who were seen as destructive and malicious. Arguments were made about their non-native origins and the troubles they caused. One proposal borrowed from Gulliver was to tame Yahoos by castration and to promote the breeding of more docile and useful asses instead. Gulliver learned of the Houyhnhnms' traditions, medicine, understanding of astronomy, excellence in poetry, simple yet effective architecture, use of body parts for dexterity, and tool-making skills. They usually die of old age, have unemotional burials, and lack words for evil, instead using "Yahoo" to describe negative things. Gulliver plans to write a book about their virtues and ends with foreshadowing his own misfortune.
The author describes his content and self-sufficient life among the Houyhnhnms, where he created a modest home and adapted to their ways, which greatly improved his virtue. He mentions his engaging conversations with them and the exchange of knowledge. Yet, he is informed by his master that he must leave, causing him great sorrow. In compliance, he constructs a canoe with assistance and sets sail, uncertain of his fate but hoping for the best. He takes an emotional leave of his master, who shows him an unexpected sign of affection, and he departs for an island he spotted earlier.
The author embarks on a risky journey, lands in New Holland (Australia) with the hope of settling, but is injured by a native's arrow. Captured by Portuguese sailors, he is treated with kindness by the captain and eventually returns to England. The voyage's experiences, particularly his time among the horse-like Houyhnhnms, leave him with a strong aversion to humankind, to the extent of distancing himself from his own family upon his return.
The author defends the truthfulness of his travel account, denouncing those who embellish their tales. He assures readers of his sincere intentions and lack of personal gain in writing his narrative. The author dismisses the notion of claiming new lands for the English crown, critiquing the unjust practices associated with colonization. He extolls the virtues of the Houyhnhnms and expresses his disdain for the vices and pride of humans, or Yahoos. The author concludes with his intention to live a simple life, applying the lessons learned from the Houyhnhnms, while slowly adapting to human society again.
