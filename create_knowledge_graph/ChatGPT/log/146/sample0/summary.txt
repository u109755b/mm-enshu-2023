Sara Crewe, a thoughtful and imaginative seven-year-old girl, travels with her father, Captain Crewe, through foggy London to a boarding school run by Miss Minchin. Raised in India and used to its climate and culture, Sara finds it difficult to adjust to the idea of living in England without her father, as children in India are often sent to England for education due to the harsh climate. Sara, who doesn't relate to other children her age and prefers books, is to become a parlor boarder with special privileges. Despite being precocious and mature for her age, Sara is humble and doesn't consider herself beautiful. During her stay with her father in a hotel, they purchase luxurious clothes and a doll, Emily, to serve as her companion after Captain Crewe leaves for India. Sara's unique outlook and old-fashioned demeanor impress Miss Minchin, though the headmistress is largely motivated by the wealth and status the girl brings. After spending lavishly on Sara, her father departs, entrusting her to Miss Minchin's care, believing his solicitors will manage the financial aspects. They say an emotional goodbye, and Sara locks herself in her room to grieve in solitude, while Miss Minchin anticipates displaying Sara's finery during school outings.
Sara Crewe, Miss Minchin's show pupil, captures the interest of her schoolmates with her fine attire and unique appearance. Sara's French background and her interactions with her French maid Mariette showcase her gentle manners and imaginative nature. Upon joining Miss Minchin's class, Sara's knowledge of French surprises both her teacher and the French master, Monsieur Dufarge, correcting the misconception that she needs to begin learning the language from scratch. Miss Minchin feels slighted by Sara's unspoken proficiency and starts to harbor a grudge against her.
Sara Crewe, the new pupil at Miss Minchin's school, befriends Ermengarde St. John, a not-so-clever but good-natured girl struggling with her studies, especially French. Despite being mocked by others, Sara shows empathy and offers to help Ermengarde with her lessons, and the two form a friendship.
Sara Crewe, a well-behaved and intelligent girl, leads a privileged life at Miss Minchin's Select Seminary due to her father's wealth and status, receiving preferential treatment that could have spoiled her. Miss Minchin privately dislikes Sara but tolerates her behavior to keep her as a pupil. Despite her indulgences, Sara is self-aware and often contemplates whether her good nature is genuine or a product of her favorable circumstances. Sara's classmate Lavinia, once the school's leader, grows jealous of Sara, who is naturally admired and never acts superior despite her advantages.  Sara's kindness is evident in her relationships with the younger students, particularly Lottie, a temperamental child who has lost her mother. When Lottie causes a scene at school, Sara manages to calm her down by offering to be a motherly figure to her and distract her with imaginative stories of heaven. Her approach transforms Lottie's behavior, and Sara becomes an adoptive mother to the little girl, demonstrating her inherent generosity and empathy.
Sara Crewe, a student at Miss Minchin's school, is admired for her storytelling ability, which captivates her peers, including a poor scullery maid named Becky. Sara's talent for making stories come alive enraptures her listeners and earns her popularity and admiration, despite other students like Lavinia being envious. Becky, the overworked and timid maid, becomes spellbound by Sara's tales and finds comfort in them during her tiring duties. Sara treats Becky kindly and promises to share more stories with her, seeing a kindred spirit in the young maid. This act of kindness deeply affects Becky, warming her heart and giving her something to look forward to.
Sara receives an exciting letter from her father discussing the potential fortune from diamond mines he has been given a chance to invest in by an old school friend. At school, this news stirs various reactions; Sara is enchanted, weaving tales of the mines for her friends, while Lavinia skeptically dismisses such wealth as implausible. An incident involving Lottie's minor injury in the schoolroom demonstrates Sara's caring nature. Sara is called "Princess Sara" both mockingly and affectionately by her schoolmates. Meanwhile, Sara befriends Becky, the scullery maid, sharing food and stories, making Becky's hard life a bit happier. Sara's loving and giving nature touches Becky deeply, with even small acts of kindness making a significant impact. Sara's eleventh birthday is anticipated with great excitement due to elaborate preparations by her father. However, Captain Crewe is feeling the pressure of his business troubles. The schoolroom is decked out for a grand celebration, and Sara receives a handmade present from Becky, which touches her heart. Becky uses a discarded card from Miss Amelia for the gift, showing her earnest desire to give Sara a proper present. Sara's response is one of grateful affection for Becky's thoughtful gesture.
Sara Crewe, previously treated like a princess at Miss Minchin's boarding school due to her father's wealth, finds her life dramatically altered when her father dies, leaving her penniless. Miss Minchin, revealing a cold and mercenary nature, informs Sara that she will remain at the school only out of "charity," demoted from student to servant, living in the attic, and subjected to hard labor alongside the scullery maid Becky. Despite this, Becky and Sara's bond strengthens, with Becky proclaiming Sara will always be a princess at heart, no matter her circumstances.
Sara Crewe experiences hardship after her father's death, moving to an attic room and transforming from pupil to servant at Miss Minchin's school. Forced into labor, she faces cruelty and loneliness but finds solace in imagination and a few kindred spirits, including her friend Ermengarde and the scullery maid Becky. Despite her circumstances, Sara's resilience and imagination help her maintain dignity and hope.
Lottie doesn't understand the changes in Sara's life after she faces adversity and goes from being a well-to-do student to an impoverished teacher at Miss Minchinâ€™s school. Lottie visits Sara's bleak new attic room, but Sara's imagination makes it seem more pleasant. They watch sparrows and imagine a cozier space, showing the power of imagination even in hardship. Sara befriends a rat she names Melchisedec and shares her meager food with his family. Despite their situation, Sara and her attic neighbor Becky find solace in their friendship and the stories Sara creates, highlighting the resilience and escapism of storytelling.
Sara, once known as Princess Sara, now lives a lonely life at Miss Minchin's seminary, where her visits with friends Ermengarde and Lottie are rare due to the fear of getting caught after hours. Though richer and admired in the past, she now endures poverty and neglect, going on errands in shabby clothes, feeling excluded from the world bustling around her. She finds solace in observing a cheerful family she nicknames "the Large Family," whom she envisions as having romantic, literary names. One evening, Guy Clarence from the Large Family mistakes Sara for a beggar and offers her a sixpence, which she reluctantly accepts, and afterward, the Large Family comes to regard her as "The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar." Despite her hardships, she finds affection with the school's little ones, talking to birds and a rat named Melchisedec, and even pretends her doll Emily has feelings, until one night, overwhelmed by her situation, she lashes out at Emily, before resigning to the reality that Emily can't feel. Meanwhile, the vacant house next door is taken by a rich Indian gentleman, who is unwell and has a mysterious link to the father of the Large Family. The arrival of this new neighbor sets off a wave of speculation and potential excitement for Sara.
Sara often escapes to view sunsets from her attic window, feeling they connect her to a wider, more beautiful world. One evening, after a vibrant sunset, Sara encounters Ram Dass, an Indian servant, and his monkey. She communicates with him in Hindustani, helping him retrieve his monkey and both share a moment of cultural connection. Sara, though treated poorly at Miss Minchin's, reminds herself that internally she is a princess, dignified and unbreakable, drawing comfort from this idea even when being punished or humiliated. Her unbreakable spirit and imagination keep her above the daily harshness she endures.
Sara, living next to the Indian gentleman's home, imagines the life beyond the walls and develops a fondness for her unseen neighbor. She considers him a friend and sympathizes deeply with his troubles, which include a severe illness and past misfortunes involving his wealth and mines. Ermengarde and Sara discuss their lack of affection for their own relatives, contrasting that with the fondness one can feel for strangers. The Indian gentleman, Mr. Carrisford, grapples with guilt over losing his friend Crewe's fortune, which he later recuperated. He's haunted by the unknown fate of Crewe's daughter, whom he desperately wishes to find. As he confides in Mr. Carmichael, Sara simultaneously experiences her own struggles with hardship and retains kindness despite her challenges. Both on their respective sides of the wall, Sara and Mr. Carrisford yearn for connection and resolution to their worries.
Sara endures a harsh winter, working as a servant and imagining better circumstances to cope with her misery. She befriends Becky, sharing stories that transport them to warmer, more inviting places. Despite her own hunger from being denied food as punishment, Sara finds a fourpenny piece and selflessly buys buns, giving most of them to a hungrier beggar child. The baker's generosity in response to Sara's action and her promise to help the child further reflect the kindness sparked by Sara's princess-like nature. Meanwhile, as Mr. Montmorency from the Large Family prepares for a journey, possibly to find the lost daughter of Captain Crewe, Sara returns to Miss Minchin's school, unnoticed and unappreciated, carrying the weight of her reality.
Melchisedec, a rat, witnessed two men, Ram Dass and an Indian gentleman's secretary, enter the attic through the skylight while Sara was out. The men investigated the room and made plans to improve it, noting its dismal condition. They discussed Sara's harsh life and observed how she befriended animals and a few people despite being mistreated by the household's mistress. Ram Dass shared how he and the Indian gentleman, Sahib Carrisford, were entertained by and cared for Sara's well-being, even planning to secretly enhance her living conditions. The secretary recorded the attic's state and the two men left as quietly as they came, discussing hopes for Carrisford to find a "lost child" who could restore his health. Melchisedec, initially frightened, was relieved by their departure.
Sara Crewe, living next door to an Indian gentleman, and enduring harsh treatment at Miss Minchin's school, finds comfort in pretending and imagining better things. One rainy day, she encounters Miss Minchin's wrath and the cook's spite, as her shoes are ruined and she's denied a proper meal. Despite this, her spirit remains unbroken, and she takes solace in a visit from her friend Ermengarde and the company of the attic's rat, Melchisedec.  Sara narrates stories to Ermengarde, promising to help her with her lessons. They share a moment of fantasy about being royalty, contrasting their grim reality. Their night is brightened when Ermengarde brings a hamper of delicious food, and they share a celebratory feast, including Becky, a servant girl. They are, however, caught by the furious Miss Minchin, who punishes all involved.  Left alone, Sara confronts both her hunger and the loss of the feast. She falls asleep hungry and awakens to a transformed attic with a warm fire, a feast, and a note from a mysterious friend, convincing her that magic has intervened to care for her in her time of need. She shares this newfound joy with Becky, reassuring her that their suffering has been alleviated by this unexpected miracle.
Sara and Becky spend a delightful evening with a comforting fire, food, and the belief that Sara has an unknown benefactor. They later find their previously cold attic transformed into a cozy room with new items arriving frequently. Sara's appearance markedly improves with the new clothing she receives, and her mysterious friend is thanked through a note she leaves in the room. Despite the continued harshness from Miss Minchin and others, Sara's happiness is sustained by the magical changes in her life. One evening, she rescues the escaped monkey from the cold and decides to return him to his owner the next day.
Three children from the Large Family are in Mr. Carrisford's library to cheer him up as he awaits news from Mr. Carmichael in Moscow regarding the lost daughter of his deceased friend, Captain Crewe. While the children attempt to keep quiet, a discussion about the missing heiress, whom they call the "little un-fairy princess," arises. Mr. Carrisford is concerned because the friend who lost Crewe's money is actually him, and he is guilt-ridden. When Mr. Carmichael returns, he reports that the child found in Moscow is not Crewe's daughter. As they consider searching London schools, Sara Crewe, the child next door Mr. Carrisford has been unknowingly assisting, returns his pet monkey. After revealing that she was born in India and is now a mistreated drudge at Miss Minchin's, Mr. Carrisford realizes she is the lost child they are seeking. Sara learns that the man she is speaking to was her father's friend, Mr. Carrisford, and they have been searching for her for two years, not knowing she was living right next door.
Mrs. Carmichael helps Sara understand that Mr. Carrisford was not the wicked friend that lost her father's money but believed he had. He fell ill, and by the time he recovered, Sara's father was dead, and he couldn't find Sara. He was kind and had been trying to make her life better, unknowingly taking care of her by instructing his servant, Ram Dass, to help. Mr. Carrisford is now well, wants Sara to live with him, and plans to rectify things with Miss Minchin. Miss Minchin, angry at losing Sara, tries to claim her but learns Sara's fortune has been restored and has expanded greatly. Sara now has a guardian and friend in Mr. Carrisford and will not be returning to the seminary. The pupils and staff at Miss Minchin's school are astounded by the news, and Becky learns she will work with Sara, continuing their friendship.
Sara, a once-poor girl now adopted by the wealthy Indian gentleman Mr. Carrisford, captivates the Large Family with her past sufferings and adventures. Regarded as a "priceless possession" by them, she shares her stories, including the magical transformation of her attic when kind-hearted Ram Dass, Mr. Carrisford's servant, brought warmth and comfort to her space unbeknownst to her, making her believe in magic. Mr. Carrisford grows fond of Sara, creating joyful surprises for her and nicknaming her "the princess." Together, they make a plan to help hungry children by providing them food through the local bun-shop. The plan brings joy and assistance to those in need, recalling Sara's own experiences with hunger and creating compassionate connections. Sara and Mr. Carrisford's relationship blossoms as they share stories and kind deeds, embracing a life filled with friendship and generosity.
