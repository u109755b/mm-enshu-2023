Sherlock Holmes stayed at Baker Street, and the next morning the King of Bohemia visited, eager to reclaim a compromising photograph from a woman named Irene Adler. Despite being married to an English lawyer, Norton, the King still worried about the potential scandal. Holmes discovered that Adler had outsmarted him and left the country with her husband. She left behind a letter explaining how she had eluded Holmes and assuring she would keep the photograph only for her protection and not to harm the King. The King was impressed by Adler's intelligence and, satisfied that the photograph would not be used against him, offered Holmes a reward. Holmes requested the photograph as his reward and left, contented. Irene Adler was referred to by Holmes as “the woman,” acknowledging her cleverness and impact on him.
