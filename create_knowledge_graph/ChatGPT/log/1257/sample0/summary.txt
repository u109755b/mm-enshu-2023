The author found the memoirs of M. d'Artagnan in the Royal Library and was intrigued by the non-mythological nature of characters with names ending in -os and -is, leading to a deep investigation. They came across an unknown manuscript with the names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, which contributed to their forthcoming history, hoping it will achieve success and lead to further publication, and invites readers to enjoy the forthcoming story.
In the first chapter of the novel, the market town of Meung experiences turmoil reminiscent of past conflicts. Citizens arm themselves and converge on the Jolly Miller inn where a young man, D'Artagnan, has arrived on an odd-looking horse, drawing public attention. D'Artagnan, who is just eighteen and resembles a young Don Quixote, is mocked for his horse's appearance, causing him distress since he values the animal, a gift from his father, highly. Before leaving for Paris, his father advised D'Artagnan to be brave, honor his noble ancestry, and to not shy away from duels. His only inheritance being a few crowns, a horse, and a letter to M. de Tréville, captain of the Musketeers.  In Meung, D'Artagnan's horse draws laughter and ridicule, particularly from a mysterious gentleman, which leads to a quarrel. D'Artagnan's attempt to confront the man results in a fight where he's outnumbered and beaten. As he recovers, he learns that the gentleman, who may be connected to the king's Musketeers, has left, casting doubt on D'Artagnan's letter of introduction to M. de Tréville.  Struggling to pay his bill due to his limited funds, D'Artagnan realizes his precious letter is missing. He suspects the gentleman who mocked him might have stolen it. Without proper equipment, he decides to complain to M. de Tréville about the incident. He sells his horse in Paris and rents a modest apartment before seeking out M. de Tréville, hoping to join the Musketeers and fulfill his father's aspirations.
M. de Tréville rose from humble beginnings to become the captain of King Louis XIII's Musketeers, thanks to his intelligence, audacity, and loyalty—qualities that were also recognized with a noble motto and arms by Henry IV. Despite intrigues and the challenges of court life, Tréville maintained honest intentions and was revered by his Musketeers, who feared and respected him. Amid the competitive atmosphere of the royal court and the cardinal's guards, D'Artagnan arrives in Paris and is struck by the brashness and rivalry among Tréville's Musketeers. Sentiments about the king are mixed and carefully expressed, whereas disdain for the cardinal is more open. D'Artagnan manages to gain an audience with Tréville, stepping into a world of political maneuvering and dueling valor.
M. de Tréville, in ill humor yet polite, greets D'Artagnan who is seeking an audience. The Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, are summoned and reprimanded by Tréville for a recent incident that prompted the king to consider recruiting his Musketeers from the cardinal's Guards. D'Artagnan admires the Musketeers but wishes himself away when Tréville scolds them for their conduct and likens them unfavorably to the cardinal's Guards. Porthos explains they were ambushed, leading Tréville to soften and offer support. Athos, injured and thought dead in the skirmish, enters but soon collapses from his wound.  D'Artagnan, seeking to join the Musketeers and avenge the theft of his letter of introduction, is offered support by Tréville after he shares his resentment towards the man who wronged him. Tréville writes a recommendation for D'Artagnan to join the Royal Academy. As Tréville hands over the letter, D'Artagnan spots the man who stole his letter and rushes out to confront him, leaving Tréville to wonder about his abrupt departure.
D'Artagnan, in a rush, collides with Athos, followed by an altercation in which he also unintentionally offends Porthos with his cloak. D'Artagnan schedules duels with both after heated exchanges. He later accidentally involves himself with Aramis by picking up a handkerchief, leading to further misunderstanding and setting another duel. After these events, D'Artagnan reflects on his foolishness and misfortunes, realizing his day has brought him into conflict with three respected musketeers.
D'Artagnan, new to Paris and without friends, attended his duel with Athos alone, prepared to apologize and fight without a second. Fully aware of his inexperience, he strategized to overcome his opponents – Athos, Porthos, and Aramis – through tactics and sheer determination. At the duel, Athos awaited him with two friends, the inseparable Musketeers Porthos and Aramis, which surprised D'Artagnan. As they prepared to duel, the cardinal's Guards arrived to arrest them for illegal dueling. D'Artagnan, choosing to side with the Musketeers, joined the fight against the Guards. Through skilled combat and strategy, the Musketeers and D'Artagnan successfully defeated the Guards, solidifying D'Artagnan's dream of becoming a Musketeer and marking the beginning of his camaraderie with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. They then triumphantly returned to M. de Tréville's hôtel.
M. de Tréville, the captain of the Musketeers, reports to King Louis XIII regarding a dispute involving his Musketeers. Despite a public admonishment, he supports them privately. The king, preoccupied with various issues and initially annoyed with the Musketeers for their brawls, is approached by de Tréville who defends his men and blames the cardinal's Guardsmen for instigating trouble. After a discussion, which includes a recount from D'Artagnan about a recent skirmish, the king shows his support for the Musketeers by rewarding them. Despite Cardinal Richelieu's displeasure, the king plans to place D'Artagnan in the company of the Guards with the prospect of him joining the Musketeers later.
D'Artagnan consults his Musketeer friends on how to spend his money; Athos suggests a meal, Porthos a lackey, and Aramis a mistress. The meal is enjoyed with Athos' pick, Planchet, as the lackey. Despite some initial disappointments, Planchet is optimistic about serving D'Artagnan, especially after witnessing his wealth. Athos’ valet, Grimaud, is quiet and obedient, with a unique way of communicating. Porthos is boastful and his servant, Mousqueton, turns old clothes into respectable attire. Aramis, aspiring to the church, has a servant, Bazin, who is pious and dedicated. Each Musketeer and valet reflect one another’s personality. D'Artagnan is curious about his friends' backgrounds, especially Athos's nobility and past heartache, but learns little. Athos gambles, Porthos boasts, Aramis is secretive, and D'Artagnan struggles with his servant Planchet until he asserts his authority. Their fellowship is strong, with a routine of visiting M. de Tréville and a bond that keeps them frequently together. D'Artagnan becomes a Guardsman with a possibility of becoming a Musketeer in the future.
King Louis XIII's money runs out for the four companions, and they struggle financially. They rely on temporary relief from sources like gambling and borrowing, but ultimately fall into distress. The hungry group scavenges for meals from friends, and D'Artagnan feels inadequate for contributing less to their sustenance. As D'Artagnan ponders the potential of their formidable alliance, he receives a visitor, Monsieur Bonacieux, who reveals a court intrigue involving his wife's abduction due to her connection to the queen. Bonacieux suspects the abduction relates to royal politics rather than romance and indirectly implores D'Artagnan's help by offering to absolve his rent and pay him. Just as they discuss the matter, D'Artagnan spots the suspicious man from Meung outside and rushes out to confront him, leaving Athos and Porthos puzzled. The companions believe D'Artagnan's pursuit relates to his previous mysterious encounters and decide not to interfere, while the landlord flees to avoid trouble from the ensuing conflict.
D'Artagnan failed to catch the man who abducted his landlord's wife; he searched and even knocked at the house the man leaned against but found it deserted for six months. Returning home, he vented his frustration, discussing the disappearance, potential lost earnings, and his suspicions about the abductor's identity with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. D'Artagnan sends his servant to get wine from his landlord, who they consider bribing for information. The conversation shifts towards the queen's situation, Buckingham's involvement, and whether this relates to the abduction D'Artagnan is investigating. As they discuss plans, their landlord, pursued by the authorities, bursts in seeking protection. Despite his pleas, D'Artagnan cleverly convinces the officers he supports his landlord's arrest to buy time. After toasting with the guards, the Musketeers reaffirm their "All for one, one for all" motto and resolve to feud with the cardinal.
D'Artagnan discovers the use of a "mousetrap," a trap set by the police in M. Bonacieux's apartment to secretly arrest and interrogate suspected criminals. He witnesses Madame Bonacieux being taken and decides to help her. They manage to escape together and hide in his friend Athos's apartment. To establish an alibi, D'Artagnan visits M. de Tréville and adjusts his clock to account for his whereabouts during the time of the incidents.
D'Artagnan contemplates his growing affection for Mme. Bonacieux, dreaming of romantic encounters and receiving gifts from her, which were common gestures of the time. His musings on love and desire, however, are contrasted with the present danger and intrigue surrounding them. M. Bonacieux's arrest and D'Artagnan's commitment to his friends highlight the complex mix of loyalty, love, and duty the musketeer apprentice faces.  After separating from Mme. Bonacieux, D'Artagnan learns that Athos has been mistakenly arrested in his place, demonstrating Athos's loyalty. D'Artagnan aims to inform their friends, but is sidetracked when he spots Mme. Bonacieux and, mistaking another for Aramis, follows them to intervene. After a tense confrontation, he discovers the man with Mme. Bonacieux is the Duke of Buckingham. Realizing his mistake, D'Artagnan pledges his service to the duke, who accepts, instructing him to follow at a distance. The episode concludes with D'Artagnan reuniting with Porthos and Aramis, keeping the night's events to himself.
Mme. Bonacieux and the Duke of Buckingham enter the Louvre without issue, thanks in part to the duke's Musketeer uniform and Mme. Bonacieux's familiarity with the area. Risking her reputation, Mme. Bonacieux leads Buckingham through a series of corridors and locked doors into a private chamber, leaving him there temporarily. Buckingham, undaunted by the potential dangers of his situation and emboldened by his romantic quest, anticipates a meeting with Queen Anne of Austria despite knowing he had been lured to Paris by deception. His past attempts to see the queen and her initial refusal are recounted, alongside the political repercussions and the personal sacrifices made for their love.  When they eventually meet, their conversation is filled with expressions of impossible love and the queen's fear for her honor and Buckingham's safety. She insists they must part ways permanently due to the innumerable risks and the sanctity of her vows. Nevertheless, Buckingham persists, recounting past encounters and professing his unwavering love, undeterred by the potential cost of his quest. Anne of Austria is affected by his passion but stands by her decision that they must never meet again.  The meeting ends with Buckingham receiving a casket from Anne as a memento and leaving, promising to see her again within six months, even if it means causing chaos. Mme. Bonacieux then safely escorts him out of the Louvre once more.
M. Bonacieux, a minor and somewhat neglected character entangled in political and amorous intrigues, was arrested and harshly treated by officers who brought him to the Bastille. He was later interrogated, not in his cell but in an examination room, by a commissary. Despite Bonacieux’s professions of ignorance and loyalty to the Cardinal, the commissary accused him of high treason and seemed to imply a connection between Bonacieux's situation and his wife's actions. After various interactions and misunderstandings involving identities and loyalties, Bonacieux remained imprisoned, confused, and increasingly anxious about his fate. Eventually, he was taken from his dungeon and transported by carriage to an unknown destination, fearing execution at each turn but ending up fainting from stress and fear.
Bonacieux, mistaking a crowd's attention on a hanged man for anticipation of an execution, is escorted by guards at the command of Cardinal Richelieu. He's disoriented and doesn't resist. Initially fearful, he realizes there's no immediate threat when left in a well-furnished antechamber. The Cardinal questions him about his wife's suspected conspiracy with the queen and Duke of Buckingham. Richelieu manipulates Bonacieux, who inadvertently reveals information. The Cardinal plans to have Buckingham, who is expected at a ball, secretly watched by Milady to obtain two of his diamond studs. Richelieu then continues his strategic planning for the siege of La Rochelle.
M. de Tréville, captain of the Musketeers, learned from D'Artagnan and Porthos that Athos had not returned and Aramis was absent for family reasons. Concerned, he inquired and found that Athos was detained in Fort l'Evêque after being questioned like Bonacieux, though Athos maintained his innocence. Despite the efforts of the Men of the Robe to take revenge on the Men of the Sword, Athos's reputable connections created hesitation. Tréville argued for Athos's release, confronting the king and the cardinal with his defense. The king, initially outraged by a Musketeer's interruption in a police investigation, was swayed by Tréville's loyalty and insistence on the Musketeers' innocence, as well as by his reminder of Athos's service. After debate and the cardinal’s withdrawal from judgment due to perceived bias, Tréville secured Athos's release, highlighting the Musketeers’ integrity and the cardinal's manipulations. Despite his release, Tréville anticipated further challenges from the cardinal. The chapter concludes with a note that the Duke of Buckingham had secretly visited Paris, adding to the political intrigue.
Louis XIII was perturbed by the news of Buckingham in Paris, suspecting a conspiracy with the Queen. The King and Cardinal Richelieu considered seizing the Queen’s papers to uncover her potential collusion. Trusting that she wrote to Buckingham, the King seeks to obtain her letters. After an intense confrontation with the chancellor sent to search her, the Queen reluctantly handed over an undelivered letter. The letter revealed a political plot, not an affair, prompting the King to consider a fête, and Richelieu to advise highlighting the Queen's diamond studs, calculating time for another matter to resolve.
Cardinal Richelieu has mentioned diamond studs to King Louis XIII, raising the king's suspicions of underlying mysteries. The king's plan is to extract information from Queen Anne of Austria about the cardinal's intentions to outmaneuver him. Consequently, the king confronts the queen pressing her to wear the studs for an upcoming ball. Distressed by the conversation, the queen fears the cardinal's influence over the king and prays for help.  Madame Bonacieux, a young woman devoted to the queen, overhears the queen's troubles and offers her help to retrieve the studs from the Duke of Buckingham in London. The queen, although initially doubtful, trusts her and gives her a letter and a ring to finance the mission. Madame Bonacieux convinces her recently released husband, Bonacieux, to be the messenger, but he's reluctant, fearing the cardinal's wrath. After a heated argument, Bonacieux agrees to see the cardinal's agent instead, Rochefort, for further instructions, leaving Madame Bonacieux frustrated and determined to accomplish the mission.
D'Artagnan overhears a conversation revealing that Mme. Bonacieux's husband, a mercer, is collaborating with the cardinal's police against the queen. D'Artagnan offers his assistance to Mme. Bonacieux, declaring his love and willingness to serve her and the queen. She is hesitant but ultimately decides to trust him and reveals a secret mission regarding the queen's interests. They plan for D'Artagnan to secure a leave of absence from his regiment, and she provides him with a sum of money, which humorously belongs to the cardinal, to aid in his quest. While they are plotting, M. Bonacieux returns, suspecting nothing, and they overhear him providing the cardinal's agent with false reassurances about Mme. Bonacieux's ignorance of any conspiracies. As Bonacieux departs to reaffirm his wife's loyalty to the cardinal, D'Artagnan prepares to leave on his mission, promising to be worthy of the queen's gratitude and Mme. Bonacieux's love. After he leaves, Mme. Bonacieux prays for the queen's and her own protection.
D'Artagnan consults with M. de Tréville regarding an urgent mission involving the queen's honor, potentially her life. He receives leave of absence for himself and his friends, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, to carry out a secret task. The mission, necessitating swift and covert travel, is to deliver a letter to London with the cardinal's agents likely aiming to thwart them. The Musketeers plan to travel separately to avoid suspicion, armed and ready for any confrontation. They agree to meet and depart within half an hour, each taking a share of the funds d'Artagnan has for the journey.
Four adventurers depart Paris, remaining silent throughout the night but become more lively with daylight. They overcome a confrontation in Chantilly, leave Porthos behind after a duel, and encounter an ambush where Aramis is injured. The group, now diminished in number due to Porthos staying behind and Aramis being injured, arrives in Amiens but has to leave Aramis with his servant Bazin. D'Artagnan and Athos, now alone, suspect foul play when encountering issues with their horses and face further troubles at their inn. They manage to escape a trap set by the inn's host, leave the city, and after a scuffle where D'Artagnan acquires an order for passage by defeating the Comte de Wardes, they sail for England.  Upon arrival in Dover, D'Artagnan and his servant Planchet press on to London. D'Artagnan, unfamiliar with the city, endeavors to meet the Duke of Buckingham. Despite the fatigue, D'Artagnan's relentless determination leads him to Buckingham, who fears for the Queen's safety. After delivering a letter from the Queen, which hints at her peril, D'Artagnan and Buckingham head swiftly back to London to address the urgent crisis.
D'Artagnan recounts to the Duke of Buckingham his journey and the events that transpired, including how his friends helped him escape the Cardinal's men, resulting in D'Artagnan making it safely to England with the queen's letter. Duke Buckingham is surprised that D'Artagnan was not stopped by the Cardinal's agents and learns from D'Artagnan of the Countess de Winter's possible involvement with the Cardinal. Upon checking the casket with the diamond studs, they discover two are missing, presumably stolen by the Countess.  Buckingham takes action by ensuring no ships can leave for France, which would delay the delivery of the stolen studs to the Cardinal. He also plans to replace the missing studs with duplicates and takes elaborate measures to ensure their creation within his palace by the skilled goldsmith O’Reilly. Buckingham then offers D'Artagnan—whom he greatly admires for his service and loyalty to Queen Anne—assistants for his return journey to France.  D'Artagnan insists his actions are for France and not for personal gratitude. He receives detailed instructions and resources for his return trip, including relays of horses and a password system to expedite his journey. He departs by ship, noticing a mysterious woman on board another vessel, and follows Buckingham's instructions, obtaining horses and directions at various stops along the way, ensuring a rapid and secure return to Paris. Upon arrival, D'Artagnan heads directly to M. de Tréville to resume his duties.
The chapter describes the grand ball hosted by the aldermen of Paris for the king and queen, highlighting their involvement in the ballet La Merlaison. Extensive preparations for the event were made, including luxurious decorations and heightened security. During the ball, tension arose between the king and queen over missing diamond studs, cleverly orchestrated by Cardinal Richelieu. However, the queen managed to outwit the cardinal by wearing the studs after all. A subplot involves D'Artagnan, who receives a token of appreciation from the queen and instruction to meet his love interest, Mme. Bonacieux, indicated by a note he will find at home.
D'Artagnan returns to Paris without incident, despite the late hour, and is greeted by his lackey Planchet, who informs him of a mysterious letter that has appeared in his room. The letter is from Mme. Bonacieux, arranging a meeting at St. Cloud, which fills D'Artagnan with both joy and anticipation. Planchet and D'Artagnan discuss the odd manner in which the letter arrived, but D'Artagnan dismisses his concerns, overjoyed at the rendezvous. In the morning, D'Artagnan instructs Planchet to prepare horses for an evening trip and encounters his landlord, M. Bonacieux, with whom he has a conversation about recent events, including Bonacieux's own imprisonment and the mystery around the disappearance of his wife. D'Artagnan then has a meeting with his captain, M. de Tréville, who warns him to be cautious of the Cardinal's revenge and advises him to sell a diamond received from the queen for safety. D'Artagnan reaffirms his loyalty to the queen, refusing to sell the jewel. Tréville also suggests D'Artagnan check on his friends, who have been previously injured or detained. D'Artagnan finds that none of his friends nor their lackeys have returned, and contemplates their fates. He also becomes suspicious of his landlord's behavior after talking to Planchet. Despite the warnings and odd occurrences, D'Artagnan resolves to keep his evening appointment.
D’Artagnan prepares to leave for an appointment and is joined by his armed servant, Planchet. They ride out discreetly at night to St. Cloud, where D’Artagnan is to meet Mme. Bonacieux. Planchet becomes fearful in the deserted streets and when they reach a dark woods, he moves closer to D’Artagnan for security. Upon arriving at the pavilion where the meeting is to take place, D’Artagnan waits but becomes anxious as Mme. Bonacieux does not appear. Investigating, he finds signs of a struggle, a woman’s glove and traces of a carriage and horses that suggest a kidnapping. D’Artagnan hears from an old man a detailed account of a violent abduction of a woman by several men, led by a tall dark gentleman and a short man. Fearing the worst, D’Artagnan seeks more clues and promises the old man secrecy. Exhausted and confused, D’Artagnan falls asleep in a tavern, wakes up at dawn, and finds his lackey, Planchet, outside with the horses.
D'Artagnan visits his friend Porthos, who is pretending to be injured to cover up losing money and a horse in a gambling loss, and is also waiting for financial help from his wealthy mistress. D'Artagnan plans to continue searching for their friends Aramis and Athos.
D'Artagnan visits Aramis, who contemplates re-entering the Church after an incident reminds him of his previous religious ambitions. Despite his melancholic disposition, Aramis is overjoyed to receive a letter indicating that his affection for a woman is still reciprocated. The reunion prompts celebration, and they shift from the idea of a modest meal to a more festive one, casting aside Aramis's initial plans for piety.
D'Artagnan and Athos plan to search for their friend Athos. Aramis, recovering from an injury, agrees to join despite his pain. D'Artagnan has been given horses by the king, one of which he offers to Aramis. The friends set out, but Athos, struggling with pain, must stay behind. D'Artagnan goes to find Athos, who has created havoc at an inn, getting drunk and causing damage. Despite the host's distress, Athos and D'Artagnan settle the disruptions. Athos shares a story of a nobleman he knew who married a young woman, only to discover she was a branded criminal, leading him to hang her in retribution. The tale reflects the darker aspects of love and honor, with Athos using it to advise D'Artagnan on his own love troubles.
D'Artagnan and Athos discuss a cryptic conversation they had while drunk, as D'Artagnan seeks clarity on Athos's revelations. Athos attempts to evade the topic by commenting on his issues with alcohol. Later, Athos details how he gambled away his horse and equipment, but won back D'Artagnan's ring, which he had also wagered.   The Musketeers reconvene, sharing their recent misfortunes, including lost horses and decreased funds, but devise a plan to regain their financial footing. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are in need of money to prepare for an upcoming campaign, while D'Artagnan has been promised entry into the Musketeers. Despite their individual setbacks, the group strategizes to pool their resources and finance their needs, considering D'Artagnan's ring as a potential source of funds.
D'Artagnan is the most preoccupied of the four friends because, despite being a Guardsman and thus more easily equipped than the higher-ranking Musketeers, he's both frugal and vain. He's also worried about Madame Bonacieux, whom he can't find information about. Athos has decided not to equip himself and plans to fight if nothing happens by the deadline, to die for the king and avoid outfit costs. Porthos is confident in his plan but undisclosed. Aramis is anxious and uncommunicative. The lackeys, too, are affected by the somber mood. As the friends wander the city, D'Artagnan notices Porthos at a church and observes his flirtations. Porthos makes a spectacle of holy water to attract a lady, but D'Artagnan recognizes her as Milady, an enemy. Meanwhile, the procurator's wife, believing Porthos is engaged in an affair, confronts him. They reconcile when she offers to help him financially by feigning that he is a relative. They agree to meet the next day to discuss her potentially inheriting everything from her elderly husband.
D'Artagnan follows Milady and orders Planchet to prepare horses for a ride to St. Germain. He converses with Athos about his lost love, Madame Bonacieux, and his desire to unravel a mystery surrounding another woman. D'Artagnan encounters Planchet's acquaintance, Lubin, and learns Lord de Wardes is recovering from wounds likely inflicted by D'Artagnan. After witnessing an argument between Milady and a cavalier (who is her brother), D'Artagnan offers to intervene but is declined. The cavalier, recognizing D'Artagnan from a previous encounter, initiates a challenge. They agree to duel later with their friends as seconds. D'Artagnan informs his Musketeer friends of the duel, and they prepare excitedly for the encounter.
At a designated rendezvous point behind the Luxembourg, the Musketeers and their lackeys prepare for a confrontation with the Englishmen, making sure they are left undisturbed by bribing the local goatkeeper. The English adversaries find their French opponents' names amusing and unfit for a proper duel, but are convinced of their nobility after private introductions. The duel proceeds intensely as Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan skillfully combat their English counterparts.  Athos swiftly kills his opponent, consistent with his claim that his identity must remain secret or else he'd be compelled to kill. Porthos injures his adversary and takes him away, while Aramis's opponent flees. D'Artagnan deftly disarms his foe, sparing his life out of consideration for the man's sister.  Subsequently, the magnanimous actions of the Musketeers—refusing to keep a fallen foe's purse and giving it to the Englishmen's servants—garner admiration, contrasted with the discontent of their own lackeys. D'Artagnan is then introduced to Milady Clarik by Lord de Winter, who hints at possible future aid from Milady due to her court influence. Despite past involvements and suspicions of Milady's connections to the Cardinal, D'Artagnan is entranced and purposefully ingratiates himself with her, while also encountering the amorous attention of Kitty, Milady's maid. His visits to Milady become more frequent, with each occasion ending with a charming encounter with Kitty, who goes unnoticed by a distracted D'Artagnan.
Despite Porthos's recent successful duel, he remains focused on an upcoming dinner with the wife of a procurator. With high expectations, he dresses meticulously and heads to her home, dreaming of her wealth and a luxurious meal. Upon arrival, the setting disappoints him with its modesty, and the procurator's wife, Mme. Coquenard, greets him amidst subdued surroundings and clerks. Anticipating the dinner, Porthos finds the meal meager and the wine poor, but continues in hopes of accessing Mme. Coquenard's husband's wealth. After the lackluster dinner, a discussion about Porthos's military equipment leads to Mme. Coquenard offering financial help, but less than Porthos desires. The arrangement ends with her providing some funds and a promise of a horse and mule for Porthos's campaign needs. Despite some flirtatious attempts by Mme. Coquenard, Porthos leaves, adhering to his duties but frustrated by the stingy affair and still hungry.
D'Artagnan is increasingly infatuated with Milady, despite his friend Athos's wise advice. He believes Milady will eventually reciprocate his love. One day, he is led by the soubrette, Kitty, to her room, where she reveals that her mistress, Milady, does not return his affection and is actually in love with another man, Comte de Wardes. D'Artagnan is initially in disbelief but becomes convinced when Kitty shows him a letter intended for de Wardes. Despite Kitty's own feelings for D'Artagnan and her reluctance to help him woo Milady, she is ultimately persuaded to assist him. D’Artagnan hatches a plan to use Kitty to intercept Milady's letters and to gain access to Milady's chamber. D'Artagnan's motivations are a mix of a desire for revenge and an insatiable passion for Milady. He decides to forge a response from de Wardes to Milady's letter to secure a meeting with her, hoping to have his vengeance and satisfy his passion before leaving for an upcoming campaign. Despite feeling used and heartbroken, Kitty helps D'Artagnan in his deceitful plan.
The four friends—Aramis, Porthos, Athos, and D'Artagnan—have not been meeting regularly due to their separate pursuits, but they agree to gather weekly at Athos's residence. During one such meeting, they discuss their affairs: Aramis contemplates returning to the Church, influenced by Athos's belief in free will. Porthos reveals he has been helped out of financial trouble by a noblewoman, and he is summoned away by his servant Mousqueton. Aramis is visited by a mendicant from Tours with a letter, prompting him to leave hastily. Left alone, Athos and D'Artagnan speculate on each other's plans, with Athos probing D'Artagnan about his connection to a suspected Englishwoman. D'Artagnan is hesitant to share all the details, fearing Athos's judgment. The mendicant brings Aramis money from a noblewoman with whom he has a romantic connection. Subsequently, D'Artagnan and Aramis plan to dine with Porthos and Athos. On their way, they spot Mousqueton with a mule and a horse that was a poor replacement for a gift Porthos was supposed to receive. Porthos, convinced to seek revenge or make amends with the procurator's wife who was involved in the gift exchange, is lured to her residence under the guise of resolving their financial dispute. The chapter explores themes of loyalty, honor, and the interplay between social status, romance, and economic transactions among the characters.
D'Artagnan visits Milady and finds her in a good mood, aware that his letter had its intended effect. Kitty, Milady's servant, is distraught despite her mistress's kindness, after delivering D'Artagnan's message. D'Artagnan internally criticizes the nature of the two women, feeling pity for Kitty and contempt for Milady. As the evening progresses, Milady signals D'Artagnan to leave, which he interprets as gratitude rather than flirtation. He departs, pondering Milady's affection for him, but finds Kitty upset, having been rewarded by Milady for her role in D'Artagnan's plan.  In the darkness of Milady's chambers, D'Artagnan pretends to be her lover, De Wardes, experiencing jealousy and sadness hearing her declarations of love meant for another. When it's time to part, D'Artagnan and Milady emotionally arrange to meet again.  The next day, D'Artagnan seeks advice from Athos who recognizes Milady's new gift to D'Artagnan, a ring, which has a connection to his own past. The discussion makes D'Artagnan reconsider his relationship with Milady, deciding to end it. Athos warns him of the danger she poses.  Despite grieving this decision, he writes Milady a letter as De Wardes, postponing their next encounter indefinitely, which confounds and angers her, demonstrating her volatile nature in love and revenge.
Milady arranges for D’Artagnan to visit her with the intention of using him for revenge, feigning affection. Despite suspecting her motives, D'Artagnan is swayed by her charms and agrees to avenge her upon De Wardes. He questions his actions but is intoxicated by Milady’s embrace, even as she manipulates him with lies about De Wardes. They plan another meeting to finalize their plans.
D'Artagnan avoided going immediately to Kitty's room, considering his own thoughts and suspicions about Milady, whom he loved despite her not reciprocating his feelings. Contemplating his situation, he decided writing to Milady was best, admitting that he and De Wardes were one and the same and explaining his inability to kill De Wardes due to it being akin to suicide. Despite this, he was driven by a desire for revenge and wished to conquer Milady in his name.  Walking around and observing Milady's apartment, d'Artagnan eventually decided to meet her, led by a mix of love and a want for vengeance. Overcoming Kitty's objections, d'Artagnan encountered Milady, who initially appeared welcoming. Their night together masked under false pretenses led to intimacy. When pressed about his plans to duel De Wardes, d'Artagnan brushed it off, causing Milady to become suspicious of his intentions.  D'Artagnan, feeling triumphantly loved, suggested to Milady that she forgive De Wardes. She remained adamant about De Wardes deserving death for deceiving her. Upon being asked if he truly loved her, d'Artagnan confessed that he was De Wardes, causing Milady to react violently. During the escalation, d'Artagnan discovered Milady bore the mark of the fleur-de-lis, branding her as a criminal. This shocked him, but also fueled Milady's rage since her secret was now known to him.  Milady attempted to kill d'Artagnan, but he defended himself and fled to Kitty's room, locking Milady out. Escaping the hôtel disguised by Kitty, d'Artagnan left Milady to recover from her faint, her plans thwarted and her secrets exposed.
D'Artagnan, in a state of distress and followed by patrol cries, runs to Athos's door, startling Grimaud and Athos himself. Despite the disguised commotion, Athos recognizes D'Artagnan, who reveals a terrifying encounter with Milady, who is marked with a fleur-de-lis. The two discuss the need for caution, as enemies surround them, especially with the cardinal's hatred. Athos forfeits his family jewel, a sapphire, which they pledge for funding their military needs, obtaining three hundred pistoles instead of the two thousand it's worth. With the money, they purchase equipment and a horse for Athos, as well as a cob for Grimaud. Athos is generous and does not seek to negotiate, showing noble character. D'Artagnan, too, manages their finances prudently. With additional funds obtained by selling the jewel, they finalize their preparations to leave Paris.
D'Artagnan and his friends, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, are anxious about a mysterious letter instructing D'Artagnan to discretely observe carriages on the road to Chaillot. Athos suspects it's a trap, but they decide to go display their new outfits and be cautious. D'Artagnan also receives a summons from the cardinal. Despite concerns from his friends, D'Artagnan decides to attend both appointments. They proceed with their plans, borrowing and discussing horses for travel. Amidst their cavalcade, they meet their commander and discuss D'Artagnan's summons without revealing the private letter. D'Artagnan sees Mme. Bonacieux in a passing carriage but obeys the letter's warning not to follow. Concluding that if she's alive, they'll meet again, D'Artagnan continues with his plan to meet the cardinal, despite the risks and his friends' readiness to rescue him from potential imprisonment. Upon arrival at the Palais-Cardinal, D'Artagnan feels uneasy, but maintains a brave front and proceeds to meet with the cardinal, who is revealed to be writing a play.
Cardinal Richelieu and D’Artagnan have an intense discussion where the Cardinal offers D’Artagnan a position in his guards. D’Artagnan respectfully declines, fearing the impact it would have on his honor and friendships, particularly with his allies who are in the King's Musketeers. Despite the Cardinal’s veiled warnings about enemies and the offer of protection, D’Artagnan remains resolved to prove himself through his actions in the upcoming campaign. Preparations for departure occupy the next day, with D’Artagnan and his friends spending one last rowdy night together before setting off on their respective assignments. Meanwhile, Porthos takes leave of his affair with Mme. Coquenard, and Athos remains sullen. As the company departs, an unidentified observer (Milady) singles out D’Artagnan to two mysterious men, who begin to follow him discreetly as the company marches out from Paris.
The Siege of La Rochelle was a major event in Louis XIII's reign and Cardinal Richelieu's military career, necessitating the city's capture due to its significance to the Huguenots and for being an English-accessible port. Richelieu aimed to eliminate this Calvinist stronghold not just for political reasons but also to enact revenge against his romantic rival, Buckingham, who also sought his own vengeance. The political and personal intertwined as Buckingham launched a surprise attack which initially succeeded but was eventually curtailed. D’Artagnan, part of a vanguard and separated from his friends, escaped an assassination attempt connected to the conflict but realized the assailant may hold valuable information. He retrieved a letter, confirming an enemy, Milady, was behind the attempt on his life, with links to the cardinal. Despite a subsequent attack at the siege, where his cunning and bravery saved him and killed his attackers, D’Artagnan managed to survive yet remained unaware of the full extent of Milady's reach and vengeance.
In the camp, there are reports of the king's recovery, and D'Artagnan, now calmer, worries about not hearing from his friends. However, he receives a letter from Godeau, indicating his friends sent D'Artagnan Anjou wine while temporarily confined. D'Artagnan decides to share the wine with fellow Guardsmen, and a dinner is planned. During the dinner, an alarm suggests an attack, but it's actually the king's arrival with reinforcements. When the four friends reunite, they are pleased but soon realize the wine was poisoned after one of their group succumbs to it. The friends suspect it's a revenge scheme from an enemy, and after addressing the immediate danger, discuss their perilous situation. They contemplate strategies for dealing with this threat and the safety of D'Artagnan's love, Constance, who is in a convent. The chapter ends with the friends considering how to gain more information and planning to meet again later.
The king, eager to confront his enemy Buckingham and eager to lay siege to La Rochelle, is delayed by internal disputes amongst his commanders. Marshals Bassompierre and Schomberg vie for command against the king's preference, the Duc d’Angoulême, leading to separate commands being designated to maintain unity. Strategic placement of the King's forces around La Rochelle is detailed, and plans to drive the English from the Isle of Ré are set.  English forces suffer from inadequate provisions and the rough seas, suggesting an inevitable withdrawal by Buckingham. However, the king, anticipating another assault, opts for a decisive action and succeeds in repelling the English, who leave behind casualties and captured materials, prompting celebrations and chants of victory in France. The cardinal can thus continue the siege without concern for the English.  News, however, breaks of an alliance against France, implicating the queen and Mme. de Chevreuse, adding to the cardinal's concerns. Amid conspiracy and assassinations attempts, the cardinal remains vigilantly aware of international politics, fearing the consequences of the foreign league's success. Meanwhile, life in the siege camp for the Musketeers, including Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, is relatively relaxed, with less formal duties and time for leisure at local establishments like the Red Dovecot.  During a night outing, the Musketeers encounter and are subsequently challenged by the cardinal himself. After some initial misunderstanding, mutual recognition occurs, and the cardinal invites the Musketeers to accompany him as a precaution against ambuscades and to use their reputation to his advantage.  A past dispute at the Red Dovecot is raised, with the Musketeers recounting their successful defense of a lady's honor against drunken aggressors, leading to injuries among the assailants. The cardinal’s questioning reveals his concerns about the lady's identity and safety, but he accepts the Musketeers' version of events.  The scene culminates at a discreet meeting at the inn where the cardinal briefly meets a cloaked man and sends him towards Paris. The Musketeers are instructed to wait, while the cardinal proceeds upstairs unaccompanied, intimating a familiarity with the inn and its purposes.
Our three friends, the Musketeers, unknowingly aided someone favored by the cardinal. Porthos began gambling while Athos, the contemplative one, overheard a secret conversation through a broken stovepipe. Athos listened as the cardinal instructed Milady to travel to England and gain the Duke of Buckingham's trust, informing him of the cardinal's awareness of his plans against France. The cardinal sought to ruin the queen if Buckingham advanced, using secret intel and threats to prevent conflict. Athos, after relaying the gist through signs, then left on a secretive errand related to their host’s suspicious comments, while Porthos and Aramis stayed behind, unaware of the complete details.
Cardinal Richelieu finds the Musketeers and notices Athos is missing; Porthos says Athos is scouting due to safety concerns. After winning a dice game with Aramis, Porthos and the others agree to accompany the cardinal. Meanwhile, Athos watches Milady from a distance, returns to the inn under false pretenses, and confronts her about her past misdeeds, demanding a secret paper from her. When she hesitates, he threatens her at gunpoint, and she surrenders the document. Athos instructs men to escort Milady to her boat. Later, as the cardinal passes by, Athos covertly indicates he obtained the paper. Milady decides to remain silent about Athos's threats to carry out her mission and seek revenge later. She embarks on a ship supposedly bound for Bayonne but actually heads for England.
D'Artagnan joined Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at their lodging where they discussed plans in secrecy, as the walls at the inn were thin and they feared eavesdroppers. The four decided to have breakfast at the bastion Saint-Gervais, which they had taken the night before, as a private place to converse and to fulfill a bet with M. de Busigny and others that they would stay there for an hour despite any danger. They encountered fellow soldiers and made the bet official before heading out, leaving their muskets behind. They anticipated finding weapons from fallen soldiers at the bastion to defend themselves if necessary. Despite some concerns by D'Artagnan and Grimaud, Athos reassured them and led the group to the bastion, all while being observed by more than three hundred soldiers and the bettors they left at the camp gates.
Athos leads an expedition to a bastion, with D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis. They find the bastion occupied by corpses, collect weapons, and discuss their situation discreetly. Athos points out the importance of the bodies, hinting they could be used to their advantage. During breakfast, they reinforce their position and Athos reveals he saw Milady, which shocks D'Artagnan due to her past attempts on his life and her recent betrayal to the cardinal. The musketeers defend the bastion against an approaching troop, utilizing the corpses as a decoy, then they retreat, discussing how to handle Milady and the consequences of her actions. They eventually decide to deceive and inform Lord de Winter, her brother-in-law, about Milady's plots, and to seek help in reaching the queen to warn her. Back at camp, after a victorious return, discussion turns to their lack of funds, but Porthos suggests that they sell the diamond ring that belongs to Queen Anne. With everyone agreeing, the musketeers plan to send their lackeys to carry out the tasks ahead. The cardinal acknowledges the valor of the musketeers, especially Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, and arranges for D'Artagnan to serve in the same company as his friends.  The summarized results: Athos leads an expedition to a bastion, where they find corpses and collect weapons. Athos mentions having seen Milady, concerning D'Artagnan. They defend the bastion against troops, tricking them with the bodies. Considering Milady's threat, they decide to inform her brother-in-law and the queen of her plots. They debate finances and plan to sell the queen's diamond to fund their actions. The cardinal commends their bravery, and D'Artagnan is assigned to the same company as the musketeers.
Athos coined the term "family affair" as a way to avoid the cardinal's investigation; it was a matter only for those involved. Aramis, Porthos, and D'Artagnan each made a discovery to help their cause against Milady, but D'Artagnan struggled with the task due to the memory of Milady paralyzing him, although he did manage to sell his diamond.  The group decided to protect themselves and retaliate against Milady by sending secret messages guarded by their trustworthy lackeys. Drawing upon their lackeys' strengths and weaknesses, the four friends deliberated on which of their servants would be best suited for the critical task of delivering a sensitive message. Eventually, they agreed upon using the greed of their lackeys as the determining factor.  Aramis composed a letter to inform Lord de Winter of Milady's intentions and past, while also fabricating a false message to a relative to mislead the cardinal.  Planchet and Bazin were chosen to deliver the messages, with Planchet carrying a critical note to Lord de Winter and instructed to protect him from an assassination plot. Bazin's task was to deliver a misleading letter designed to throw off any enemies.  While waiting for Planchet's return, the four friends are on edge, feeling the pressure and fear of danger from all sides. However, Athos encourages them to remain calm and drink wine to keep their spirits high.  Planchet eventually returns on time, to the relief of the group, and delivers his report.  The success of their plans hangs in the balance as the group reads the succinct reply: "Thank you; be easy." This cryptic message indicates that their efforts have been acknowledged and seemingly appreciated, suggesting a possibly positive outcome.
Milady, consumed by vengeance and feeling insulted by D’Artagnan and Athos, begged the captain of the ship to return her to France, but was refused as the captain hurried to England. Reflecting on the possible wrath of the Cardinal upon her return and the ongoing events in London, Milady decided not to press further for disembarkation at Brittany ports. Arriving in England, she was greeted by sights of preparation and power, comparing herself to Judith of biblical fame. On attempting to land, her ship was approached by a boat from a formidable English cutter. An officer boarded and scrutinized everyone, particularly Milady, but did not address her. The officer, appearing to take command, ordered the ship escorted. Milady, despite her observant nature, could not read the impassive officer.  As they reached the shore, the officer ensured Milady's transfer to a waiting carriage under close supervision, asserting it was standard procedure during wartime. Though skeptical, Milady complied, and after a lengthy, mysterious journey, arrived at a dark, remote castle by the sea. There, she finally questioned her treatment, demanding to know why she was being held. The officer explained her stay was ordered and awaited another person to take over. Lord de Winter then revealed himself, confirming the castle as his, designating Milady as his near-prisoner, and requested a private conversation.
Milady is held captive by Lord de Winter, her brother-in-law, who discovers her arrival in England and plans to send her to the colonies. During a tense conversation, she tries to manipulate the situation but realizes de Winter is aware of her treachery and plots. He warns her against escape attempts and introduces the loyal Lieutenant Felton as her guard. Milady feigns submission while de Winter instructs Felton to guard her, forbidding any communication with others. Despite her outward appearance, Milady is determined to think of a plan.
Cardinal Richelieu is increasingly anxious over the prolonged siege of La Rochelle and the absence of news from England. Despite efforts to starve out the city and psychological tactics to undermine its leaders, the Rochellais remain resilient, their hopes pinned on aid from Buckingham. Richelieu, skeptic of the besieged city's surrender, is also troubled by other political and personal matters, including speculation about the loyalty of his agent, Milady. The royal army, led by figures like Bassompierre and Schomberg, is faring well, with ample provisions and high spirits, contrasting sharply with the situation inside La Rochelle. As Richelieu rides along the beach, contemplating the situation, he encounters the Musketeers, who are outside their duty, enjoying leisure time. Their interaction with Richelieu is tense but respectful, with the cardinal reminding them of the importance of discipline. Richelieu leaves suspiciously, despite a facade of pleasantries. After he departs, the Musketeers resume their activities, alert to the cardinal's underlying hostility.
Milady, feeling defeated by her enemy D'Artagnan, is imprisoned and reflects on her situation with despair and rage. She recognizes D'Artagnan's role in her capture, having outwitted her at every turn and now threatening her life and liberty. Despite an initial bout of rage and helplessness, she resolves to use her cunning and charm to turn the situation to her advantage, particularly by targeting the more impressionable of her jailers, Felton. Even as her schemes meet obstacles, she remains determined to not be overcome, using her intelligence and seductive powers to plot her vengeance and plan her escape.
Milady, a prisoner, fantasizes about D'Artagnan's execution and manipulates those around her, feigning illness to avoid arousing suspicion. She declines a physician's visit, fearing her deceit might be uncovered. When Lord de Winter's man, Felton, brings her a book of Mass, she rejects it, feigning religious outrage to play into Felton’s Puritan sympathies. De Winter mocks Milady's supposed religious conversion, to which she responds with deflected accusations. Overhearing everything, Felton is swayed by Milady's intentional display of faith through prayer and psalm singing, further drawing him into her web of manipulation.
Milady is imprisoned and focused on seducing Felton to win her freedom. Despite being aware of her manipulation, she continues to play the victim and employs her voice as a tool of seduction. Lord de Winter visits and threatens her with exile while hinting at her sordid past, leaving her fearful yet determined to continue influencing Felton. She is given a short period before her fate is sealed, and she must convince Felton to aid her. Despite some doubts, Felton remains under her spell, torn between his duty and her influence.
Felton visits Milady, who tries to conceal a rope she made from torn handkerchiefs for an unknown purpose. Despite a sleepless night, Felton interrogates her. Milady claims ennui led her to fashion the rope. Felton, skeptical, notices a screw in the wall and questions her further. Milady talks of martyrdom over dishonor. As Felton's emotional conflict grows, Milady attempts to seduce him with her victimhood and beauty. They are interrupted by Lord de Winter, who mocks Milady's suicidal inclinations. After he leaves, Milady fails to fully convince Felton of her innocence, but he agrees to meet her again at night. She manipulates him into leaving her, contemplating her eventual revenge.
Milady de Winter uses her beauty and cunning to manipulate others but faces a challenge with Felton, who is devout and immune to her usual seductions. Over time, though, she manages to undermine his convictions. She describes and revels in her power, but also experiences moments of despair and considers evil forces in her plans. Milady prepares to seduce Felton, discussing her limited time before exile and her determination to regain power and status. She recounts her imprisonment, her captor's identity, and her efforts to fend him off, including an attempt to stab him that fails due to his armor. Milady then details her resolve to either escape or die and refuses offers of silence for freedom. The chapter ends with her captor presenting a final threat to her reputation and Milady defying him, resolved to maintain her stance regardless of the consequences.
Milady, weakened by hunger and torment, reveals to Felton an account of her victimization and shows him her brand, implying that she was punished like a prostitute. Though initially resistant, she feigns submission and calls Felton her avenger. She exposes a fleur-de-lis brand, blaming Buckingham as her true oppressor. Felton, enraged and in love, swears vengeance against Buckingham and to protect Milady. She manipulates him, playing the role of a martyr scorned. As they are about to be discovered, Milady tries to kill herself but is thwarted by her corset's steel reinforcement, only staining her clothes with blood. Lord de Winter dismisses the situation, as Milady is not dead, and a physician is sent for.
Milady's feigned injury convinces her caretaker, allowing her to plot her escape with the enamored Felton, who believes he is acting in righteous favor against the wicked Milady. Despite setbacks, including being discovered and Milady fainting, they successfully flee via a boat Felton arranges. As they sail towards France, Milady learns of Felton's further plans to ensure her exile and his commitment to their escape, despite the cost. They plan to meet at a convent in Béthune if separated.
Felton bid farewell to Milady and traveled to Portsmouth. His behavior seemed calm, but his intense gaze suggested inner turmoil. In Portsmouth, Felton meditated on the public and private crimes of the Duke of Buckingham, feeling the duke's hidden transgressions were more egregious. Upon reaching the town, bustling with preparations for war, Felton, using Lord de Winter's name, gained access to Buckingham, who was preoccupied with dressing. Felton brought up Milady de Winter's imprisonment and insinuated Buckingham's wrongdoing towards her. Despite Buckingham's resistance, their conversation grew heated, and Felton, proclaiming divine retribution, assassinated the duke just as a letter from Anne of Austria, which pleaded for peace, arrived.  With Buckingham dying, the palace was thrown into chaos. Lord de Winter, having seen signs of Milady’s escape, arrived too late and blamed himself for not anticipating Buckingham's murder. Before his death, Buckingham read Anne's letter and found a measure of peace, knowing she still loved him. Felton remained unrepentant, believing he delivered justice for both personal and patriotic reasons.  News of Buckingham’s death spread, causing despair, and Felton was apprehended. Lord de Winter reproached him, seeing him as merely Milady’s tool for revenge. Felton mistakeningly assumed his actions were justified, unaware of Milady's deeper machinations and betrayal.  Milady, already having escaped, sailed away from England as Felton was captured, leaving him to realize her deceit. Lord de Winter vowed vengeance on Milady for orchestrating the events, while Felton, accepting his fate, held onto his fatalistic beliefs until the end.
Charles I of England, fearing the Duke's death might dishearten the Rochellais, sealed the ports to prevent the news from spreading until Buckingham's army had departed, also detaining ambassadors. Two ships had already sailed, one with Milady, confirmed in her suspicions by seeing a black flag on the admiral's ship; the destiny of the second ship is undisclosed. Meanwhile, bored King Charles decided to attend the festival of St. Louis incognito with only twenty Musketeers, a request Cardinal Richelieu gladly granted. M. de Tréville chose D'Artagnan and his friends, the four young musketeers, to join the escort, avoiding their need to stay in camp.   Aramis, concerned about Madame Bonacieux's safety from Milady at the convent, sought the queen's permission for her to leave, which was humorously obtained through his seamstress acquaintance Marie Michon. The Musketeers secured an order to retrieve Mme. Bonacieux from the convent and, despite being far from Paris, they were able to accompany the king to the capital on a short leave. Joyful, they prepared to set out, but a grim Athos convinced D’Artagnan to take caution because Milady posed a great danger.  Their journey included a quick departure and the capture of a paper that leads them to Armentières, spurring them on with new resolve as they hurried on their quest.
Milady, a master manipulator with a predestined knack for evading danger, safely arrives at the Carmelite Convent in Béthune after cleverly deceiving people in both England and France about her identity. Her beauty and demeanor gain her easy access and favor wherever she goes. At the convent, she convinces everyone, including the superior, of her noble intentions, masking her true connection to Cardinal Richelieu. Meanwhile, she is internally consumed by a mix of passions and plans, yearning for revenge and power, anticipating a reunion with her manipulator and controller, Richelieu.  In conversation with the abbess and a young novice, who is revealed to be Mme. Bonacieux, Milady carefully navigates her lies to discover more about the political and personal tensions at play, and to confirm her suspicions about the novice's identity. She ultimately uncovers that Mme. Bonacieux is an unwitting rival for the love of D'Artagnan, and that the novice expects his imminent arrival, believed to be for her rescue. While reinforcing her image as a victim of the cardinal rather than a co-conspirator, Milady secretly revels in the chaos she can still orchestrate as she awaits her orders from Richelieu.
Milady and Rochefort meet unexpectedly. Rochefort brings news of Buckingham's death or serious injury, which pleases them as it will delight the Cardinal. Milady informs Rochefort of her surprise encounter with Madame Bonacieux, who is unaware of Milady's true character. They discuss the Musketeers: D'Artagnan and Athos being threats, Aramis being involved with Madame de Chevreuse, and Porthos being deemed unworthy of concern. They suspect the Musketeers are on their way to take Madame Bonacieux away. Milady plans to stay hidden and use her lackey to communicate with Rochefort, who will return to the Cardinal with updates. They exchange plans and resources, with Milady asking for a backdoor escape route from the surrounding woods and Rochefort heading towards Arras, where he is later recognized by D'Artagnan, which pushes the Musketeers to hasten their journey.
Milady, under the guise of a woman coming to help, poisons Mme. Bonacieux who eventually dies despite D'Artagnan's attempt to save her. D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are all present, along with Lord de Winter, who turns out to be Milady's brother-in-law. Plans are hinted at for vengeance against Milady, whose true identity and connection to the men is revealed. They decide to stay at an inn where Athos takes charge of the situation, proclaiming his personal stake in seeking retribution, as Milady is revealed to be his wife.
Athos, overtaken by grief yet mentally sharp, planned a search for Milady with his four loyal lackeys, Planchet, Grimaud, Bazin, and Mousqueton, who each took separate routes to Armentières. After sending them off, Athos, seeking information, ventured into the night, only to be met with fear and silence from those he questioned. His persistence led him to a solitary house, home to a man who studied natural sciences, where after some reluctance and the revelation of a seal on a document, the man agreed to help Athos. The next day, as the funeral for the poisoned victim proceeded without news of Milady, Athos followed her tracks from a forest to where she changed carriages after wounding her escort. Concurrently, Planchet uncovered similar clues leading to a tavern in Armentières, where Milady was reportedly staying. Athos's group, resigned yet resolute, prepared to confront her, joining a mysterious cloaked figure before embarking on their somber journey.
On a stormy night, Athos restrains an eager D'Artagnan as their group encounters silence, storms, and hints of a secretive pursuit throughout their journey. Communicating through gestures, they understand Grimaud has spotted their quarry. A dramatic confrontation ensues where D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and Lord de Winter accuse Milady of multiple crimes, including murder and poisoning. An executioner from Lille reveals her past atrocities and the suffering she inflicted upon his family. The group unanimously sentences Milady to death for her heinous crimes, and she is taken away, leaving the chamber desolate.
Milady is executed by an executioner accompanied by Lord de Winter, D'Artagnan, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, following a tense encounter where she tried bribing her captors and proclaiming her innocence. Despite Milady's pleas and attempts to escape, including an offer to become a nun, the execution proceeds. Athos and the others individually forgive her before her death. After the act, the body is disposed of in a river. The four Musketeers return to Paris, having completed their grim task, and report being "well amused" to their captain, M. de Tréville.
King Louis XIII left for La Rochelle, and upon learning of Buckingham's assassination, the queen initially denied his death but ultimately accepted the reality. The king displayed open joy over Buckingham's death but soon fell back into despondency. Cardinal Richelieu continued to have a strong influence over the king. The four friends, Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan, exhibited sorrow during their travels. They met Chevalier de Rochefort, who was to arrest D'Artagnan on the cardinal's orders. However, Athos convinced Rochefort to let them escort D'Artagnan to the cardinal since they were already on their way. They reached Surgères, where the cardinal and king celebrated the assassination of their enemy. Cardinal Richelieu met with D'Artagnan, initially confronting him about being charged with serious crimes but ended up destroying an incriminating paper and offered D'Artagnan a lieutenant's commission in the Musketeers after learning of Milady's death. D'Artagnan offered the commission to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who each refused for their reasons, leaving D'Artagnan to accept the role himself while reflecting on the bittersweet changes in his life.
La Rochelle surrendered after a year-long siege when English support failed. King Louis XIII entered Paris triumphantly in December 1628. D’Artagnan assumed his command while Porthos retired and married, with a substantial dowry. Mousqueton attained his dream of serving a wealthy household. Aramis joined a convent, Bazin became a lay brother, and Athos left the Musketeers after inheriting property. Grimaud followed Athos. D’Artagnan and his rival Rochefort reconciled after multiple duels. Planchet rose to sergeant thanks to Rochefort, while M. Bonacieux vanished mysteriously after recalling himself to the Cardinal.
