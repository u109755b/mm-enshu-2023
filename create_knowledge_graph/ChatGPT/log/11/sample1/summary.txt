Alice, fatigued by inactivity, follows a talking White Rabbit down a deep rabbit hole, leading to a bizarre adventure. As she plummets down the well, she ponders her new environment filled with cupboards and jarred orange marmalade. She lands safely and embarks on a journey through a dim corridor, trying to gain entry to a radiant garden. After tasting a bottle marked "DRINK ME," she shrinks, but forgets the key to the small door leading to the garden. Her subsequent consumption of a cake hoping to alter her size, only to find she remains unchanged, reflects her adaptability to the whimsical world's absurdity.
Alice experiences a dramatic change in size, expressing wonder and concern for her feet, which now seem very far away. She imagines sending gifts to her feet and is struck by the absurdity of her thoughts. As she grows to over nine feet tall, she cries a pool of tears before shrinking again due to fanning herself. The White Rabbit passes by but is frightened away by Alice. During her size changes, Alice ponders her identity, recites nonsensical verse, and ultimately falls into her own pool of tears, meeting a mouse and other creatures there. She attempts to converse with the mouse, but inadvertently offends it by mentioning cats and dogs. The chapter ends with Alice and the mouse planning to go to shore, where the mouse will explain its aversion to cats and dogs.
A group of wet, uncomfortable creatures convene with Alice on a riverbank to figure out how to dry off. After some discussion, they decide to run a Caucus-race, which involves running in a circle until they dry off. Following the race, prizes are distributed, but there's confusion over who has won. Alice hands out comfits she has in her pocket as prizes for all, and presents a thimble as her own prize after a suggestion by the Dodo. The gathering requests the Mouse to share a story, but Alice disturbs the tale with her remarks, causing the Mouse to leave. When Alice mentions her cat Dinah, the assembly of animals disperses, leaving Alice feeling lonely and hoping to see her cat again.
Alice encounters the White Rabbit searching for his lost fan and gloves. Mistaking her for his maid, he sends her home to fetch them. Alice enters the Rabbit's house, finds the items but drinks from a bottle and grows too large to leave. In desperation, she eats a cake, shrinking herself, and escapes outside where commotion ensues. After considering her next steps, she encounters a large puppy and then spots a caterpillar smoking a hookah atop a mushroom.
Alice converses with a Caterpillar who questions her identity and discusses changes in size. Alice attempts to recite "Father William," but gets it wrong. The Caterpillar instructs Alice about the mushroom, which can alter her height. After experimenting with the mushroom, Alice alters her height several times. She encounters a pigeon that mistakes her for a serpent due to her long neck and they discuss the pigeon's issues with serpents. Alice then manages to adjust her size to normal and contemplates how to enter a beautiful garden, finding a small house to approach at a reduced size.
Alice observes the Footman (who looks like a fish) deliver an invitation for the Duchess to play croquet with the Queen. The Footman is indifferent to Alice knocking and they discuss entry to the house as dishware flies out the door. Inside, Alice encounters a tumultuous scene in the kitchen, with the Duchess nursing a baby amidst chaos. The cook throws kitchenware while the baby sneezes from the pepper-filled air. Alice questions the Cheshire Cat's grin after the Duchess abruptly leaves and is told that everyone there is mad. The baby turns into a pig, and Alice releases it before consulting the Cat about which direction to go, ending up deciding to visit the March Hare's house.
Alice attends a bizarre tea party hosted by the March Hare, the Hatter, and a sleeping Dormouse. She finds their manners rude and the conversation nonsensical, revolving around unanswerable riddles and illogical statements. The Hatter and the March Hare speak of time as a person, and the perpetual tea-time result from the Hatter's quarrel with time. When asked, the Dormouse tells a confusing story before Alice leaves the party in frustration. She then finds her way back to the beautiful garden she'd been seeking.
Alice encounters gardeners painting white roses red to avoid beheading for planting the wrong roses. A grand procession, including the King and Queen of Hearts, arrives, and the Queen orders executions for trivial reasons but is temporarily talked down. Alice is introduced to the Queen and asked to play croquet, which is a chaotic game with live animals as equipment. The Cheshire Cat appears, much to the King's dismay, leading to a debate about executing the cat, which lacks a body, and the Queen sends for the Duchess, whom the Cat was earlier sentenced by the Queen. The Cat fades away before the execution can occur, and the party resumes their croquet game.
Alice reunites with the Duchess, who is in a better temper, and they discuss various morals. The Duchess philosophizes about finding morals in everything while Alice questions some of her nonsensical statements. Their conversation ends abruptly when the Queen arrives and demands the Duchess to choose between leaving or losing her head. The Queen then takes Alice to resume the croquet game, where she threatens the other players with execution for any delay. After the game, the Queen asks Alice if she has seen the Mock Turtle, and upon hearing that she hasn't, decides to take her to meet him. Left with the Gryphon while the Queen attends to executions, Alice is taken to the Mock Turtle. The Mock Turtle tells his story about attending school under the sea and learning various subjects, boasting about his education. The Gryphon and Mock Turtle recount their schooling experiences, replacing common lessons with absurd underwater alternatives, and avoiding the topic of the games the Queen mentioned.
The Mock Turtle, sobbing and joined by the Gryphon, explained to Alice the steps of the Lobster Quadrille, a whimsical dance performed under the sea with lobsters as dance partners. Alice watched as they demonstrated the dance and sang nonsensical songs. The Gryphon and Mock Turtle then discussed other sea creatures such as whiting and their reasons for attending the dance. Amidst Alice's confusion, the chapter concluded with the Gryphon whisking her away to a trial, while the Mock Turtle's song about beautiful soup faded into the distance.
The King and Queen of Hearts preside over a court where the Knave of Hearts is on trial for stealing tarts. Alice observes the proceedings, which include the King acting as judge, jurors taking notes, and a parade of witnesses including the Hatter and the Cook. During the trial, Alice begins to grow larger, causing some disruption, and is finally called as a witness.
Alice, having grown large, accidentally knocks over the jury box during her trial, feeling compelled to pick up the jurors as she would rescue goldfish. When questioned by the King, she says she knows nothing about the incident being judged. The King deems her statement important, but the White Rabbit corrects him to 'unimportant'. Various nonsensical events follow, including the King inventing a rule to dismiss Alice for being too tall, a nonsensical letter read in court, and the Queen demanding a verdict before evidence. Ultimately, Alice defies the Queen, who orders her beheading, but no one obeys. Alice then realizes everything around her is a pack of cards and awakens from her dream on her sister's lap. Her sister reflects on the dream before envisioning Alice's future adulthood.
