Alice grows bored sitting with her sister and follows a White Rabbit down a hole, entering a strange world. As she falls down a well, she encounters various objects and ponders her situation. After landing, she finds a key and a small door to a beautiful garden but can't fit through. She comes across a bottle labeled "DRINK ME" and a cake marked "EAT ME," which cause her to shrink and grow, but still not the right size to enter the garden.
Alice grows to a massive size and is surprised at the change, contemplating sending shoes to her distant feet. After shrinking down with the assistance of a fan she picked up, she ends up swimming in a pool of her own tears, where she encounters a talking Mouse. Despite her attempts at conversation involving cats and dogs, which frighten and offend the Mouse, they agree to go to the shore where it promises to tell its story. Meanwhile, additional animals have also fallen into the pool of tears.
After getting wet, a group of creatures including Alice decide how to dry off. They listen to a dry historical account from a Mouse, which doesn’t help. The Dodo suggests a Caucus-race, where everyone runs at will and all win prizes. Alice provides comfits for prizes and receives a thimble. The Mouse begins a sad tale, but Alice’s mind wanders, and the Mouse leaves offended. Alice unintentionally scares the creatures away by mentioning her cat Dinah, and she is left alone and saddened, wishing for her cat's company.
Alice encounters the White Rabbit who mistakes her for his housemaid, Mary Ann, and orders her to fetch him gloves and a fan. Alice enters the Rabbit's house and finds the requested items but then drinks from a bottle that makes her grow too large for the house. The Rabbit and his helpers attempt various ways to get inside the house, ultimately leading to Alice shrinking back to a small size after eating a cake. She then escapes and considers her next moves to grow to her proper size and explore a garden while avoiding a large puppy. Alice thinks about writing her own fairy tale based on her adventures.
In Chapter V of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," Alice has a confusing conversation with a Caterpillar about her identity and the changes in her size. The Caterpillar questions her, prompts her to recite poetry, and comments on her desire for a different size. Eventually, it informs her that different parts of a mushroom will make her grow or shrink. As Alice experiments with the mushroom pieces, she experiences dramatic changes in size, including an encounter with a pigeon that mistakes her for a serpent. Finally, she manages to adjust her size and considers how to enter a beautiful garden, approaching a small house at a reduced height.
Alice observes the peculiar behavior of a Fish-Footman and a Frog-Footman exchanging a royal invitation. She attempts to enter a house where she witnesses chaos and converses with a rude Duchess and a grinning Cheshire Cat. Alice later encounters a baby that transforms into a pig and follows the Cat's directions towards the March Hare's house, contemplating the madness of her surroundings.
Alice encounters the March Hare, the Hatter, and a sleeping Dormouse during a nonsensical tea party. They make confusing and contradictory statements, ask a riddle with no answer, and discuss the concept of time, which has been stuck at six o'clock, making it always tea-time. The Dormouse tells a confusing story about three sisters living in a treacle well, and the tea party participants move around the table to get clean cups. Alice becomes frustrated with the nonsense and leaves, only to discover a door in a tree that leads to a beautiful garden.
Alice witnesses gardeners painting white roses red to avoid execution by an easily angered Queen of Hearts, and ends up in a chaotic croquet game with live equipment and arbitrary rules. The Queen, prone to ordering beheadings for minor offenses, confronts Alice, but is temporarily appeased. A conversation with the Cheshire Cat occurs amidst the madness, leading to further decapitation orders and a confused attempt to resolve whether a head without a body can be beheaded. The Duchess is also mentioned as being under a sentence of execution.
The Duchess finds morals in everything and discusses them with Alice, who finds it perplexing. They witness the Queen's violent conduct in a croquet game, where many risk execution. The Queen then orders Alice to meet the Mock Turtle, who shares his sad tale and education under the sea, learning subjects like Reeling, Writhing, and sea-themed versions of human subjects. Alice and the Gryphon discuss the Mock Turtle’s schooling before the Gryphon suggests they move on to discussing games.
The Mock Turtle and Gryphon describe the Lobster Quadrille to Alice—a dance with precise movements and lobster partners. Alice watches a demonstration and listens to a song about a whiting and a snail debating joining the dance. Discussions on various sea creatures and their roles under the sea confuse Alice. She is then asked to recite a poem, which comes out rather nonsensically due to her preoccupation with the quadrille. As they prepare for another figure of the dance, a trial is announced, and the Gryphon hurries Alice away, cutting off the Mock Turtle's song.
Alice attends a trial where the King and Queen of Hearts preside and the Knave is accused of stealing tarts. The White Rabbit acts as a herald, and the jury comprises various creatures. The Hatter is the first witness and behaves nervously under the King's questioning. Alice, who is growing larger, causes some disruption in the court. The King, who also serves as the judge, struggles with the absurdities of the trial and the unwillingness of the witnesses, including the Duchess's cook, to cooperate. Alice is surprised when she is called to be the next witness.
Alice accidentally knocks over the jury box, which disrupts the trial. The King insists the trial cannot proceed until the jury is back in place. Alice disputes various arbitrary rulings by the King and Queen during the trial. The White Rabbit delivers questionable evidence, which leads to debate about its relevance and meaning. The Queen demands Alice's execution, but Alice grows to full size and dismisses them as just a pack of cards. Suddenly, Alice awakens on the riverbank, realizing it was all a dream. After recounting her dream to her sister, her sister imagines an adult Alice sharing the tale with her own children. The story ends with reflections on childhood and memory.
