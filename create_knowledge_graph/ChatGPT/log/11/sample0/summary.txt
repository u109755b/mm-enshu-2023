Alice, feeling bored sitting with her sister, follows a White Rabbit down a rabbit-hole, finding herself falling down a deep well into a fantastical world. Observing her surroundings during the fall, she lands safely and continues to pursue the Rabbit. Navigating through a locked hallway and after growing smaller from drinking a curious liquid, Alice finds herself unable to reach the key to a door leading to a beautiful garden. She then eats a cake hoping to change size and access the garden.
Alice grows to a gigantic size and ponders on the identity crisis she faces, contemplating if she has been changed overnight. She accidentally shrinks to two feet after using a fan and finds herself swimming in a pool of her own tears. She encounters a mouse, which she tries to befriend, but scares it with talk of cats and dogs. The mouse agrees to tell its history to explain its aversion to cats and dogs, and they swim to shore where other creatures have also gathered.
A group of wet and uncomfortable animals, including Alice, discuss how to dry off, leading to a confused and unconventional "Caucus-race" that ends with everyone receiving prizes from Alice. Later, as the Mouse relates a tale, Alice's thoughts and interruptions annoy the Mouse, prompting it to leave. Alice's mention of her cat Dinah frightens the birds away, leaving her alone and sad.
Alice encounters the White Rabbit, who mistakes her for his servant Mary Ann and sends her to get his gloves and fan. She finds her way to his house and, while searching for the items, drinks from a bottle that causes her to grow huge. Trapped in the house, she scares the Rabbit and his helpers, who then debate ways to remove her, culminating in throwing pebbles at her. These pebbles turn into cakes, and upon eating one, she shrinks and escapes. Once outside, she decides to find her way into a beautiful garden and grows to her correct size with a mushroom that a caterpillar is perched upon.
Alice encounters a Caterpillar who questions her identity, sparking a conversation about change and size. The Caterpillar advises Alice to keep her temper and later tells her that different parts of a mushroom will make her grow or shrink. As Alice experiments with these pieces, she changes size several times, eventually adjusting herself to her normal height. She also has a confusing encounter with a pigeon that mistakes her for a serpent. Alice aims to enter a beautiful garden and adjusts her size again to approach a little house.
Alice observes a house and considers her next move when a fish-like footman delivers a letter inviting the Duchess to play croquet with the Queen; the door is answered by a frog-like footman. Alice laughs at their tangled hair but hides to avoid being heard. Approaching the house, she attempts to knock but is rebuked by the frog footman who informs her of the noisy chaos inside. After an exchange about the uselessness of knocking, Alice boldly enters the kitchen filled with smoke, where a sneezy environment caused by too much pepper affects everyone except the cook and a grinning Cheshire Cat. The Duchess nurses a baby in a violent manner and engages in brief, rude conversation with Alice before being pelted with kitchenware by the cook. Alice tries to discuss the earth's rotation, only to be interrupted by the Duchess, who abruptly leaves to prepare for croquet. Alice is left to care for the baby, which soon turns into a pig. A conversation with the Cheshire Cat leads her to contemplate going to visit the March Hare or the Hatter, as suggested by the Cat who keeps appearing and disappearing, leaving only its grin behind. The chapter ends with Alice approaching the March Hare's house ahead of deciding whether to visit there or the Hatter's abode.
Alice encounters the March Hare, the Hatter, and a sleeping Dormouse having a nonsensical tea party. They discuss the concept of saying what one means, the relativity of time, and exchange riddles and stories which have no answers or logic. When offended by their rudeness and absurdities, Alice leaves the frustrating tea party and finally enters the garden she has been seeking by growing to the appropriate size using a piece of mushroom she saved.
Alice encounters three gardeners painting white roses red to correct their mistake of planting the wrong rose tree and avoid the Queen's punishment. The Queen arrives with a grand procession and demands the beheading of the gardeners, but Alice intervenes, helping them avoid execution. Alice then joins the Queen's bizarre croquet game, where the equipment is alive. The Cheshire Cat reappears, causing a dispute about its beheading due to its disembodied state, but the problem is unresolved as the Duchess, whom the Cat belongs to, is in prison.
Alice and the Duchess bond over theories of temperament, morality, and Alice's flamingo in the croquet game. The threatening Queen of Hearts reappears, causing the Duchess to hurriedly depart. The Queen then introduces Alice to the Gryphon to meet the melancholic Mock Turtle and hear his history, which includes a bizarre education in the sea. They discuss their schooling experiences, revealing the absurd curriculum of the sea creatures, before the Gryphon diverts the conversation to games.
The Mock Turtle describes the Lobster Quadrille, a whimsical sea dance, to Alice, who finds it interesting though confusing. The Gryphon and the Mock Turtle attempt to demonstrate the dance and offer to share more curious information about sea creatures and their ways. Alice tries to share her own adventures, but they insist on hearing verses which end up nonsensical due to her distraction by the Lobster Quadrille, leading to more confusion. Eventually, they are interrupted by a call announcing the start of a trial, and the Gryphon hurries Alice away, leaving the song of the Mock Turtle trailing behind them.
The King and Queen of Hearts preside over a court with various creatures and the pack of cards. Alice is observing the absurd trial where the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing tarts. The court proceedings are nonsensical, with jurors writing down their names so they don't forget, and the Hatter is called as a witness. He gives a confused testimony, prompting the King to become impatient and threaten execution. The Hatter's evidence is incoherent, discussing his tea-time and ignoring the case. The situation becomes more chaotic as the Dormouse's comments lead to his ejection from the court. The cook is the next witness, who rudely refuses to testify, adding to the disarray. Eventually, much to Alice's surprise, she is called as the next witness.
Alice, having grown large, accidentally upsets the jury box at her trial, and the King rules that the trial cannot continue until the jurors are in their proper places. When questioned by the King, Alice declares she knows nothing of the matter at hand. The proceedings become more absurd as a letter with nonsensical verses is presented as evidence, with no one able to interpret it. The Queen demands a verdict before evidence is fully heard, but Alice, now full-sized, refutes the nonsensical proceedings. The Queen orders Alice's beheading, but as the cards fly at Alice, she wakes up to find herself on the bank with her sister. It was all a dream, which she recounts to her sister before being called in for tea. Her sister stays behind, contemplating Alice's dream and dreaming herself of Alice's future growth, retaining her childlike heart and sharing her Wonderland adventures with other children.
