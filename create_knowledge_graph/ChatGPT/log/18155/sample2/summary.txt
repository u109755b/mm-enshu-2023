An old sow sends her three pigs out to seek their fortunes. The first pig builds a straw house, the second a furze house, but both are destroyed by a wolf who eats them. The third pig builds a brick house which the wolf can't blow down. The pig outsmarts the wolf on several occasions, finally tricking him into falling into a pot of boiling water, boiling him, and eating him for supper, ensuring the pig's survival and happiness.
