An old Sow sends her three pigs out to find their fortune. The first builds a straw house, the second a furze house, both of which are destroyed by a wolf who eats them. The third pig builds a brick house, which the wolf can't blow down. The pig outsmarts the wolf on several occasions and finally kills and eats the wolf when it tries to enter through the chimney. The third pig lives happily ever after.
