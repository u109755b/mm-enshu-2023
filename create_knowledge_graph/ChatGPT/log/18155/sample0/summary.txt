An old sow sends her three pigs out to seek their fortunes. The first pig builds a straw house but is eaten by a wolf after he blows it down. The second pig builds a furze house with a similar fate. The third pig builds a brick house, which the wolf canâ€™t blow down. The pig repeatedly outsmarts the wolf's attempts to catch him and eventually kills the wolf by tricking him into falling into a pot of boiling water, ensuring the pig's survival and happiness.
