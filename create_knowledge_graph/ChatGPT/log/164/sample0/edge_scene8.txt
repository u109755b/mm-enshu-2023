Professor Aronnax, Ned Land, inform about events, perception, and time, "A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told the Canadian all that had passed during his sleep." | "Quite so, Master Land; it was taking breath." | "Only, Mr. Aronnax, I have no idea what o’clock it is, unless it is dinner-time."
Professor Aronnax, Conseil, inform about events and confirm about time, "A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told the Canadian all that had passed during his sleep." | "That is my opinion."
Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, ask about well-being and inform about perception, "Did master sleep well?" | "Soundly, Professor. But I don’t know if I am right or not; there seems to be a sea breeze!"
Ned Land, Conseil, express disagreement on temperament, "That is just like you, friend Conseil,” said Ned, impatiently. “You are never out of temper, always calm; you would return thanks before grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!"
Ned Land, Steward, express anticipation and attack, "But dinner or breakfast, the steward will be welcome, whichever he brings." | "Before I could rush forward to stop him, the Canadian had thrown him down, and held him by the throat."
Conseil, Ned Land and the Steward, attempt to intervene, "Conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooner’s hand from his half-suffocated victim."
Steward, Ned Land and Professor Aronnax, request silence, “Be quiet, Master Land; and you, Professor, will you be so good as to listen to me?”
