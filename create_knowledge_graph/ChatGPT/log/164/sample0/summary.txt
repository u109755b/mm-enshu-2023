The year 1866 was marked by an enigmatic sea phenomenon that drew the attention of the global maritime community. Ships encountered a massive and swift entity larger than any known whale, generating widespread fascination and alarm. On several occasions, this creature surfaced, displaying its formidable size and strength, inciting debate among scientists, satirists, and the public. An encounter between this "monster" and the steamship Moravian alongside other similar incidents escalated concerns. Finally, when the well-built vessel Scotia suffered a mysterious hull breach attributed to the creature, it intensified the public outcry for a solution to this maritime menace.
Assistant Professor Pierre Aronnax, having returned from a research trip to Nebraska, becomes involved in the debate over a mysterious sea phenomenon after his scientific expertise is sought in New York. Two main theories exist: a colossal sea monster or a powerful submarine vessel. Aronnax leans towards the existence of a gigantic narwhal, due to the known capabilities of the common narwhal, and publishes an article suggesting this hypothesis. His theory gains support, sparking public interest and leading to the U.S. preparing an expedition on the frigate Abraham Lincoln to hunt the creature. Just before the expedition's departure, Aronnax is invited to join, implying his expertise will be invaluable.
The narrator, immediately after receiving a letter from J.B. Hobson, resolves to hunt the mythical unicorn narwhal. Despite desiring rest after a tiresome journey and looking forward to returning to familiar comforts, the call to adventure is irresistible. Conseil, his devoted and uncomplaining servant of ten years, is ready to accompany him without hesitation, even in the face of uncertain and potentially extended travels. With hurried preparations, they depart for the Abraham Lincoln, where the narrator meets Commander Farragut and settles into his cabin. Meanwhile, the frigate, geared with high-pressure engines for speed, is preparing to depart from Brooklyn, and as it begins its voyage, it's saluted by the masses and finally enters the Atlantic with full steam for the narwhal hunt.
Captain Farragut of the frigate Abraham Lincoln was determined to capture a monster cetacean believed to roam the seas. He, along with his crew and officers, were eager and prepared for the encounter, motivated by a reward for sighting the creature. The ship was well-equipped with the latest hunting weaponry, and onboard was Ned Land, an exceptional harpooner skeptical of the monster's existence. Fascinated by the depths of the ocean and the possibility of enormous creatures, the narrator engaged in a discussion with Ned about the logic and possibility of such a creature's existence, with Ned remaining unconvinced but intrigued by the scientific explanation of the extreme pressure any deep-sea creature would have to withstand.
The Abraham Lincoln's journey was largely unremarkable until Ned Land demonstrated his impressive harpooning skills by catching two whales at once. The ship sailed swiftly along South America, choosing to round Cape Horn instead of taking the Straits of Magellan. Past the tip of the continent, the crew eagerly searched for the narwhal, especially driven by a monetary reward for its discovery. The voyage continued through favorable conditions; the ship crossed the Tropic of Capricorn, the equator, and into the waters of the Pacific, avoiding shallower regions that the creature seemed to avoid.  As time passed without finding the narwhal, morale and patience aboard the Abraham Lincoln began to decline, turning the crew's enthusiasm into discontentment. Captain Farragut then promised that if the narwhal did not appear within three days, they would abandon the search and return to Europe. In an effort to lure the creature out, they tried various tactics, but to no avail. With the deadline fast approaching, the frigate stationed near Japan remained on high alert, but the creature remained elusive. As hope dwindled, Ned Land suddenly identified a target, stirring excitement anew.
The crew of the Abraham Lincoln observed a glowing sea creature, initially mistaken for a phosphorescent phenomenon. Revealed as a gigantic electric narwhal, it emitted bright light and moved with astonishing speed. The crew attempted pursuit with the frigate but couldn't match the narwhal's velocity. Captain and crew prepared for combat with the beast, as it displayed unusual agility and resilience. After a long chase and an attempt at stealthy approach under darkness, harpooner Ned Land struck the creature, resulting in turmoil on the ship and the accidental fall of the storyteller into the sea.
The narrator recounts an encounter with a mysterious creature while swimming in the ocean after falling overboard. Initially struggling with swimming due to the weight of his clothes, he is assisted by his faithful companion, Conseil. Together they attempt to survive by conserving energy and awaiting rescue from the frigate Abraham Lincoln, which was damaged by the mysterious creature and unable to steer. Despite their dire situation and fatigue, they maintain hope. Eventually, they realize the creature they're on is a man-made submarine, and they are taken inside by a group of masked men.
The narrator recounts a rapid, forceful abduction into a dark, enclosed space where he, Ned Land, and Conseil find themselves imprisoned. Initially enveloped in darkness, their prison is abruptly illuminated, revealing simple furnishings and a lack of exits. Two men, strangers, later enter; one is described in detail, but their language is unknown. Attempts to communicate in several languages fail, and they leave the captives in confusion and frustration. Eventually, a steward brings in unfamiliar clothes and food, suggesting they are dealing with a civilized group. The enigmatic commander of the vessel remains a mystery, only hinted at by an initial "N" on the dining utensils. Despite their situation, the group eats and falls asleep, their fate still uncertain as the narrator contemplates their predicament before succumbing to sleep.
The narrator and his companions awaken in their cell on the submarine, having slept long enough to feel completely rested. Upon waking, the narrator examines the cell, which remains unchanged except for a cleared table. The occupants have nearly depleted the oxygen in the cell, making the air difficult to breathe. However, they are soon refreshed by a breeze of sea air as the submarine surfaces to ventilate, much like a whale. Ned Land and Conseil awake, feeling revived by the fresh air. Ned is initially perplexed by the time of day, mistaking it for dinner time, while the narrator believes it to be breakfast time. As their hunger grows, the absence of the steward, who is supposed to bring them food, becomes concerning. Ned Land's temper worsens over two hours with no steward in sight, until the steward finally appears, and Ned, overcome by hunger, attacks him before being stopped by a voice speaking in French.
The narrator meets the commander of the vessel, who is revealed to be the enigmatic Captain Nemo of the Nautilus. Nemo is a polyglot, speaking multiple languages fluently. He explains that he had been assessing the three newcomers' identities before deciding how to interact with them, deducing that they are Professor Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land. Nemo acknowledges their accidental intrusion on his secret existence, which leads to a tense exchange with Aronnax about the intrusions and attacks on the Nautilus. Despite this, Nemo offers them hospitality aboard his submarine but imposes one condition for their freedom, which involves them being confined during certain situations they should not witness.  Nemo showcases his submarine's amenities, including a well-stocked library and a smoking room, explaining that he has renounced land-life and implying the tobacco is a kind of seaweed. The Captain then leads Aronnax through the Nautilus, showing a luxurious dining room and a vast museum containing treasures from the sea and art, revealing a deep appreciation for the ocean's solitude and a total break from the society of the surface world. The dining experience emphasizes Nemo's self-reliance and detachment from the terrestrial realm, as they dine on delicacies provided by the sea. Nemo's cabin, a stark contrast to the opulence elsewhere, reflects his austere and solitary existence, emphasizing his disconnection from the world above.
Captain Nemo showcases the navigation instruments and explains to Professor Aronnax that the Nautilus is powered by electricity derived from sea water. This power supplies light, heat, and movement, allowing the submarine to function without natural light. Electricity also drives the pumps for air and the speedometer, while an electrical clock marks time without reference to the sun. Captain Nemo reveals the existence of a small, insubmersible boat that can be launched from the Nautilus without surfacing. The Nautilus's kitchen uses electricity for cooking, and its engine room contains advanced machinery that propels the vessel at high speeds and allows it to maneuver in all directions underwater.
Captain Nemo explains to Professor Aronnax the design and specifications of the submarine Nautilus, detailing its dimensions, structure, and the science behind its ability to submerge and navigate underwater. Nemo describes the strength of the submarine's hull, its resistance to sea pressure, and its propulsion and navigation systems, which are powered by electricity and allow him to explore the ocean depths. The Nautilus is constructed from parts sourced globally and assembled on a secret island, with the overall cost being around Â£347,500. Nemo reveals his immense wealth, claiming he could pay off France's national debt.
The chapter covers the immensity of Earth's watery surface and its division into oceans, followed by a description of the Nautilus and its journey through the Pacific Ocean under the command of Captain Nemo. They aim to trace the path of the powerful Kuro-Scivo current. The Nautilus, described in great detail, surprises its passengers with views of the underwater world through its crystal windows. The passengers observe a multitude of sea life illuminated by the submarine's electric light, until the view is concealed again. The narrator, Professor Aronnax, is left alone to ponder the mysteries of Captain Nemo and his remarkable vessel, before retiring for the night as the Nautilus continues on its voyage.
The narrator wakes on November 9th after a long sleep and spends the day studying marine specimens in the saloon of the submarine Nautilus, noting Captain Nemo's absence. The next days are spent in solitude with his companions, speculating about the Captain's whereabouts. On November 16th, Captain Nemo invites them to a hunting party on the island of Crespo. Despite the captain's usual avoidance of land, they decide to participate. The narrator notes the position of Crespo and reflects on their curious fate. He then describes their preparation for the underwater hunt, including details of the equipment provided by Captain Nemo, which allows them to breathe underwater and navigate the ocean floor with specialized suits, a Rouquayrol reservoir for air, and Ruhmkorff apparatus for light. Captain Nemo explains the high-tech air gun they will use, which fires electrically charged glass balls that can kill even the strongest animals instantly. The narrator accepts the explanations and prepares to follow the Captain on the hunting adventure.
The Nautilus' arsenal and wardrobe cell contains diving apparatus for its passengers, with Ned Land showing reluctance to wear one. The crew helps everyone into heavy, seamless rubber diving suits with leaden soles and copper-lined vests to withstand water pressure, while Captain Nemo assures Ned that participation is not forced. Equipped with Ruhmkorff lamps and air guns, Aronnax and his companions follow Captain Nemo into a room that fills with water before they step onto the ocean floor. They walk on sand, see vibrant marine life, and communicate only through signs while wearing their helmets. After passing through various seabeds, they approach a dark mass, the forest of the Island of Crespo.
The narrator describes a captivating exploration of a submarine forest in Captain Nemo's domain, filled with unique flora that stretches upwards towards the ocean surface, defying usual perceptions of plant orientation. Struck by the densely populated submarine environment rich in life forms, the narrator observes a wide variety of sea plants with diverse shapes and colors, along with animals cunningly resembling plants. The adventure continues with Captain Nemo and his companions as they traverse the underwater landscape, marveling at its oddities and facing the threats posed by the local fauna, including a close encounter with a sea-spider and later, two dangerous sharks. Concluding their exploration, they are hindered by a large mass casting phosphorescent glows, which turn out to be sharks. Eventually, the group safely returns to the Nautilus, where the narrator reflects on the journey, exhausted yet amazed by the extraordinary underwater adventure.
On November 18th, the narrator recovers from previous fatigue and joins the crew of the Nautilus as they bring in a significant catch of fish, which includes diverse species. Captain Nemo reflects on the life and circulation of the ocean, likening it to the vital systems of animals. The Nautilus continues its journey, crossing the tropic of Cancer and sighting the Sandwich and Marquesas Islands but not stopping. The submarine follows a southeast course, and the crew rarely encounters large fish in the deep waters they explore. On December 11th, while the Nautilus is stationary, the crew discovers a sunken vessel, "The Florida, Sunderland," with corpses still aboard, painting a somber picture under the sea.
The Nautilus encounters shipwrecks and maritime relics on its voyage, passing by diverse island groups while discussing the creation and characteristics of coral islands with Captain Nemo, who dismisses the narrator's idea about new continents. They reach the Island of Clermont-Tonnere, part of Vanikoro, where the Nautilus explores the coral formations created by polyps. They later pass the Societies and Tahiti, before arriving amid the New Hebrides on Christmas. The narrator recounts the historical search for the lost expedition of La Perouse, who vanished in this region with his ships in 1785, discussing the subsequent findings and expeditions that unearthed evidence of his fate over decades. The Nautilus itself arrives at Vanikoro, where Captain Nemo reveals evidence of La Perouse's final days, expressing a sailorâs affinity with a grave at sea.
The Nautilus, traveling swiftly from Vanikoro, reached Papua in three days, covering 750 leagues. Conseil wished Captain Nemo a Happy New Year, and remarked on their incredible voyage, unsure if it would end in their freedom or continued exploration. The Nautilus navigated the treacherous coral sea, observed by the narrator, Professor Aronnax, who also examined marine specimens collected. Nemo intended to pass through Torres Straits into the Indian Ocean, despite its hazardous navigation. As they traversed, the Nautilus experienced a collision with a coral rock but suffered no significant damage. Nemo assured Aronnax that the tides would soon free them. Eight days later, the crew, allowed by Nemo to leave, joyfully prepared to hunt on an island, despite the dangers of the unknown game they might encounter.
The narrator recounts their time on land where they experience the local flora and fauna. Impressed by the lush landscapes and Ned Land's practical interest in coconuts, they forage for food including bread-fruits. Ned is enthusiastic about consuming the local produce. The group also hunts for meat, with difficulties in obtaining game. Eventually, Conseil shoots birds for breakfast while Ned brings down a hog. In their exploration, they encounter kangaroos, capturing several of them. Their successful hunt offers a sumptuous dinner, and they contemplate not returning to the Nautilus, but a falling stone interrupts their conversation.
The chapter describes an incident where the protagonist and companions, while on the Nautilus, are attacked by native Papuans with stones and arrows. They retreat to the submarine to escape. Inside, the protagonist finds Captain Nemo playing the organ, indifferent to the external threat. Nemo dismisses concerns about the natives, explaining the Nautilus is safe from their attacks. During subsequent events, the natives try to board the Nautilus, but are repelled by an electrified railing. Finally, the Nautilus escapes the dangerous straits unharmed as the tide rises.
The Nautilus, captained by the enigmatic Captain Nemo, travels at high speeds and continues its journey, doubling Cape Wessel and avoiding numerous reefs. On January 13th, they enter the Sea of Timor, and later the Indian Ocean, with their destination unknown. Captain Nemo conducts temperature experiments deep in the sea, finding a consistent temperature at great depths. The submarine encounters a phosphorescent phenomenon due to luminous marine creatures, which captivates the crew. By January 18th, they're at sea with an impending storm suggested by the anxious behaviors of Captain Nemo and his lieutenant. After observing something in the distance, Captain Nemo confines the narrator and his companions to their room, where they unexpectedly fall asleep, likely due to a soporific substance in their food, leaving them in a state of insensibility.
In "The Coral Kingdom," the narrator, after finding himself surprisingly back in his room, explores the Nautilus to find that everything seems normal, though Captain Nemo is not seen, and the crew is unaware of the events from the night before. The Captain later approaches the narrator, needing medical attention for a crew member. The crew member is found with a severe head wound and is beyond saving. After his death, the Captain, the narrator, and the crew take the body to a submarine coral cemetery for burial. They later go on a new underwater excursion, admiring the rich coral landscape, which is a stark contrast to the solemnity of the burial they'd just conducted.
Part two of the journey under the sea begins with a reflection on Captain Nemo's life and his grave in the ocean depths. The narrative moves to a detailed observation of sea life, including various fish and aquatic birds encountered by the Nautilus in the Indian Ocean. The ship's powerful capabilities and scientific observation equipment are discussed, accompanied by thoughts about the beauty of the underwater world and Nemo's possible motives for isolation. The Nautilus continues its journey, passing by Keeling Island and entering the northern hemisphere while encountering dangerous sharks and witnessing the death toll of the Indian villages. A mysterious milk sea phenomenon is observed and explained to be caused by a massive gathering of luminous infusoria.
The Nautilus, commanded by Captain Nemo, surfaces near Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Nemo invites Professor Aronnax and companions to visit the pearl fisheries of the Gulf of Manaar, although the fishing season has not started. Nemo mentions they may encounter sharks during the expedition but assures they will be safe. Aronnax is hesitant due to the dangers of sharks but is reassured by the composed attitudes of his servant Conseil and the Canadian harpooner Ned Land. Nemo leaves as casually as he proposed the outing. Later, Aronnax educates Ned and Conseil on the nature and formation of pearls, and while the pearl fishery is not particularly dangerous, precautions are necessary. Both Ned and Conseil express fearlessness towards potential shark encounters.
The crew of the Nautilus, including the narrator, Captain Nemo, Ned Land, and Conseil, embarked on a submarine journey to a pearl bank off the coast of Ceylon. They prepared to dive near Manaar Island, known for its pearl oysters. Captain Nemo led them to an enormous oyster containing a huge pearl, which he left undisturbed to grow. Unexpectedly, they saved an Indian pearl diver from a shark attack, with Captain Nemo and Ned Land displaying bravery. The crew returned to the Nautilus after Captain Nemo generously gifted the diver a bag of pearls. The narrator mulled over Captain Nemo's admirable qualities and his lingering connection to humanity, particularly those oppressed, like the Indian diver.
The Nautilus, a submarine commanded by Captain Nemo, traveled from the Japanese Seas through the Maldives and Laccadives, then along Arabian coasts, eventually reaching the Red Sea. Speculation arose among the passengers about Nemo's intentions, as the route through the Red Sea appeared to be a dead end. They passed by various landmarks and discussed the history, biology, and navigation of the area. Captain Nemo also revealed to Professor Aronnax their ability to bypass the Suez Canal via a secret subterranean passage that he calls the Arabian Tunnel, which connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.
The Nautilus, a submarine commanded by Captain Nemo, approaches the Arabian coast near Djeddah, floats on the surface, and later submerges to continue its voyage. The following day, they sight ships and resume a submerged navigation. The protagonist, along with Ned Land and Conseil, observes the coastline from the platform. Ned spots a gigantic dugong and, with Captain Nemo's permission, attempts to harpoon it. Despite initial failure, they eventually capture the injured dugong after an intense chase and struggle, weighing it at 10,000 lbs.  The crew of the Nautilus also captures some sea-swallows and Nile ducks. They pass the Cape of Ras-Mohammed and move towards the Gulf of Suez. Here, Moses's Mount Horeb is visible. The Nautilus prepares to enter an underwater tunnel created by Captain Nemo that leads from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, known as the Arabian Tunnel. The submarine navigates through it successfully, rapidly propelled by the torrent, and emerges in the Mediterranean Sea.
The narrator and his companions discuss their situation aboard the Nautilus with Captain Nemo and contemplate an escape when close to European coasts, thinking they might be near enough to swim or seize a smaller boat, the pinnace. Captain Nemo remains preoccupied, and during a dive, he secretly meets with a known diver and secures a chest of gold ingots, which he later sends away to an unknown recipient. They witness a volcanic underwater eruption near the Island of Santorin, forcing them to leave the area due to the unbearable heat and toxic environment. Afterward, the Nautilus leaves the Grecian Archipelago.
The Nautilus, commanded by Captain Nemo, crossed the Mediterranean Sea in 48 hours, starting from Greece on the 16th of February and reaching the Straits of Gibraltar by the 18th. Despite the Mediterranean's historical and natural beauty, Captain Nemo was eager to avoid the region and did not surface during the rapid passage, depriving the narrator of the opportunity to appreciate the scenery or learn from Nemo's knowledge. The vessel's speed of twenty-five miles per hour thwarted Ned Land's escape plans. The Nautilus navigated carefully through shallow and deep waters, notably the submarine barrier near Tunis, and relied on the crew's maneuvers and navigational tools. Conseil and the narrator discussed the geological history of the Mediterranean and potential future changes, concluding that the current state of the region will remain for many centuries, which should not interfere with their journey. They traversed the deepest parts of the Mediterranean and utilized the counter-current found below the surface to exit through the Straits of Gibraltar into the Atlantic, briefly observing the remains of the temple of Hercules before continuing their voyage.
A summary of the provided text:  The Nautilus, a submarine led by Captain Nemo, has traversed nearly ten thousand leagues and is now navigating the Atlantic, off the coast of Portugal. The crew experiences rough seas and plans an escape for that evening, hoping to take advantage of their proximity to the Spanish coast. Ned Land, Conseil, and the protagonist Aronnax have schemed to flee the Nautilus using a small boat, with preparations and provisions ready for their departure.  Despite the escape plan, Aronnax is conflicted, grappling with the ideas of liberty and abandoning Captain Nemo's hospitality. Meanwhile, the Nautilus has been refilling its tanks and is stationary beneath the ocean's surface, causing Aronnax further anxiety about the imminent escape plan.  As Aronnax waits for Land's signal to escape, Captain Nemo unexpectedly appears and begins a discussion on Spanish history, specifically the battle of Vigo Bay in 1702. The Captain reveals that they are currently in Vigo Bay, the site where Spanish galleons laden with gold sank after a battle with the English. He leads Aronnax to observe the crew collecting treasures from the sea floor, revealing the source of Nemo's wealth and hinting at a philanthropic use for these riches beyond personal gain.
Ned Land is disappointed at his inability to leave Captain Nemo's submarine, the Nautilus, which is heading away from Europe. An excursion is offered by Captain Nemo to explore the sea at night. They suit up for a deep-sea walk, without the need for electric lamps, and experience a mysterious underwater world. Eventually, they discover ruins indicating the lost continent of Atlantis. Captain Nemo is contemplative amidst these ancient remnants, and after spending some time there, they return to the Nautilus.
The narrator awoke late and observed the Nautilus still traveling south. It encountered many fish species, including large rays, sharks, and fishes with piercing swords. Later, they found the underwater landscape changing, indicating they were near land, possibly near Atlantis. The Nautilus then entered a submerged volcanic crater, now a calm lagoon, which provides a safe harbor and access to a coal mine that supplies the ship with needed sodium for power. Captain Nemo took them on a tour of the crater, where they encountered diverse geological formations and flora. Ned Land harvested honey from a hive, while they also saw birds and collected marine plants. The Nautilus had the opportunity to leave but did not immediately do so, suggesting Captain Nemo may have preferred to leave under the cover of darkness. After the stop, the Nautilus resumed its underwater voyage in the Atlantic.
The Nautilus explored the Sargasso Sea, a calm region in the Atlantic Ocean filled with seaweed and marine life, where the Gulf Stream current creates a natural gathering of floating objects. The ship encountered various sea creatures and debris from wrecks. The crew passed 19 uneventful days, with Captain Nemo keeping to himself, working and playing his organ. Later, they took deep-sea soundings, discovering depths where the bottom could not be reached, and the Nautilus experienced extreme underwater pressure. Nemo suggested and successfully took a photograph of the deep-sea environment, before quickly ascending to the ocean's surface to avoid prolonged exposure to the high pressure.
The Nautilus, under Captain Nemo's command, continues its journey south instead of heading to the Pacific as expected, causing the protagonist to worry about Ned Land's growing fears of captivity. Ned Land, quieter and agitated by the prolonged confinement, asks the protagonist about the crew size of the Nautilus to hint at a possible escape, referencing the air capacity and consumption rates of the vessel. A whale sighting temporarily distracts Ned, reviving his instincts as a harpooner, but his excitement turns to frustration as he cannot hunt them. Captain Nemo refuses to permit hunting the peaceful southern whales for sport, distinguishing between killing for necessity and for pleasure, hinting at a previous instance where hunting was allowed for food supply. A battle between cachalots (sperm whales) and southern whales ensues, with the Nautilus violently intervening to protect the whales, leaving the ocean filled with dead and injured cachalots. The violence of the scenario shakes Ned Land, despite retrieving milk from a dead whale, and his animosity towards Captain Nemo grows, causing the protagonist to become wary of the Canadian's behavior.
The Nautilus, guided by Captain Nemo, continues its journey towards the South Pole, navigating through ice formations and enduring extreme cold. Despite encountering obstacles such as icebergs and ice fields, which at one point render the submarine immobile, Captain Nemo is determined to reach the pole. Utilizing the Nautilus's capabilities to break or navigate under ice, he maintains the mission despite various challenges and the skepticism of the narrator. Eventually, they find a passage and emerge, finding the sea open.
Aboard the Nautilus, Captain Nemo and the narrator, Professor Aronnax, reach a sea teeming with life at the South Pole. Despite the unsureness of their position and heavy fog, they explore an island, and Nemo claims to have reached the South Pole on March 21, 1868, planting a flag to assert his possession. The narrative describes extensive marine life and geological features suggesting volcanic activity. The crew observes various species and notes the untouched natural habitat due to the absence of humans. However, they cannot confirm their exact location due to persistent fog and snow. The following day, as the weather clears a bit, Nemo plans to use the sun's position at noon to determine their coordinates, crucial as the long polar night is about to begin. Despite some difficulties navigating the terrain and an encounter with sea-mammals, Nemo successfully confirms their location at the South Pole as the sun lines up with the horizon at noon.
On March 22nd, the Nautilus began preparations to depart under intense cold and started descending. It became trapped under an iceberg and violently jolted, causing disarray inside. Captain Nemo appeared concerned but assured that they were not in immediate danger. The Nautilus had struck an overturned ice block, which raised it off-balance. Efforts to correct the situation were underway. Despite being trapped in an ice tunnel, the crew admired the beauty around them. A subsequent shock signaled a collision at the front, and the Nautilus began moving backward since the path ahead was blocked. As the crew waited anxiously, the Nautilus continued at a depth of more than three hundred yards, and Captain Nemo dealt with the unexpected situation.
The Nautilus, trapped beneath an iceberg, faces the threat of suffocation as their oxygen reserves dwindle. Captain Nemo and his crew, including Professor Aronnax, are attempting desperate measures to escape, from piercing the surrounding ice walls to finally forcing the submarine upward by altering its buoyancy and violently breaking through the ice. They must act quickly as the air is running out and the water around them threatens to freeze, which would seal them in completely. Despite the dangers and the physical strain of their efforts, the crew, driven by the need for survival, persist in their tireless work. They eventually succeed in breaking free by using the submarine to ram through the ice, with the rush of fresh air restoring hope and life to the crew.
The narrator recounts their journey on the Nautilus from Cape Horn to the Amazon, describing the joy of breathing fresh air on the platform after long imprisonment, and the sights along the American coasts. Captain Nemo avoids the inhabited coasts and they explore underwater wonders, such as diverse fish species and sea-cows. Despite Ned Land's desire to escape, the Nautilus continues its exploration, and the crew witnesses the interdependence of marine animals and their environment, emphasizing the ecological balance and the negative impact of human actions on nature.
The Nautilus avoids the American coast and sails near the Antilles. Ned Land is frustrated at not being able to escape, and the crew has been imprisoned for six months, traveling 17,000 leagues. Captain Nemo becomes more reclusive and stops socializing with the passengers. While near the Bahamas, the crew encounters large poulps (giant squid) which they initially discuss with skepticism, referencing legends and misconceptions. A giant squid appears, prompting a detailed observation and drawing by the narrator. The crew of Nautilus engages in a battle with this squid when it impedes their submarine's propellers, leading to a violent confrontation that results in the loss of one of Nemo's men. The crew fights off multiple squids with axes and harpoons, with Ned Land nearly falling victim before being saved by Nemo. The fight ends with the squids being driven off and an emotional Captain Nemo mourning the loss of his crew member.
Captain Nemo and his crew mourn the loss of a companion killed by a giant octopus on April 20th. Nemo is visibly affected, causing the Nautilus to wander aimlessly for days. By May 1st, they resume their northerly course on the Gulf Stream, which is described in detail. Despite the threat of a looming storm, the Canadian, Ned Land, expresses a strong desire to escape the Nautilus and return home. Tension rises when the topic of freedom is addressed with Nemo, who insists anyone aboard the Nautilus must never leave. As a massive storm hits on May 18th, the Nautilus faces the elements on the surface. Captain Nemo admirably withstands the storm outside, while the vessel proves its strength against the sea's fury. The storm's ferocity is conveyed, but the Nautilus descends to the ocean's calm depths for relief.
The Nautilus, due to a storm, is thrown off course to the northeast, diminishing hopes of landing on American shores and causing a despairing Ned to isolate himself like Captain Nemo. While Conseil and the narrator stay together, they note the dangers of thick fogs and the remnants of ocean casualties on the sea floor. The Nautilus observes the transatlantic cable, which underwent several failed attempts and sabotages before successful installation by the Great Eastern in 1866. On May 28th, near the site of an 1863 cable accident, Captain Nemo seems unusually melancholic when the Nautilus nears European shores. After searching for a specific location, the Nautilus stops above a submerged wreck, which Nemo reveals to be the Marseillais, a ship that sank 74 years ago to the day, refusing surrender and proudly going down with her crew.
The narrator is deeply impacted by the mysterious and emotional history of the patriot ship, the Avenger, and Captain Nemo's intense reaction to it. Despite witnessing the Nautilus rise to the surface and hearing a gunshot, the captain remains unresponsive and focused on a nearby ship-of-war, which is approaching and threatening to attack. Ned Land, Conseil, and the narrator speculate about the ship's intentions and nationality while the Nautilus prepares for a potential collision. Captain Nemo reveals his vengeful motives against the attacking vessel, which is from a nation he despises due to past grievances. As battle ensues, Nemo orders the narrator and his companions below deck, unfurls a black flag, and takes aggressive action to evade and counter the ship-of-war's attacks. Tensions escalate as the Nautilus prepares to strike; the narrator and his comrades plan a futile escape. The Nautilus sinks the enemy ship, and the crew's attempt to flee is thwarted as the submarine dives beneath the water. The narrator witnesses the destruction of the ship and the loss of life, realizing the extent of Captain Nemo's hatred and his capacity for vengeance. In the aftermath, Captain Nemo privately mourns before a portrait of a woman and children, revealing a personal tragedy.
The Nautilus, under Captain Nemo's command, flees the scene of a horrific act of vengeance, traveling north at a frightening pace. The protagonist, suffering from the horror of the events and Nemo's mysterious behavior, decides to escape with his companions Ned Land and Conseil. The opportunity arises as the Nautilus approaches land. Despite a perilous sea and uncertainty about their destination, they plan their escape for that night. Their plans are almost thwarted by the unexpected appearance of the Maelstrom, a massive whirlpool. As they attempt to detach their small boat from the Nautilus, the vessel gets caught in the whirlpool, and the escape boat is violently flung into the tumultuous waters, causing the narrator to lose consciousness.
The narrator concludes their undersea voyage, not remembering how they escaped a maelstrom but finding themselves safe on the Lofoten Islands. They cannot yet return to France due to infrequent communication with Norway and reflect on the accuracy and wonders of their journey. Though uncertain if their account will be believed, they assert their right to speak about the seas they've traveled. Questions remain about the fate of the Nautilus and Captain Nemo, and the narrator hopes both have survived. They wish for an end to Nemo's vengeance and a peaceful continuation of ocean exploration, highlighting the strangeness and sublimity of their shared experience, paralleling only Captain Nemo in answering Ecclesiastes' ancient contemplation of nature's depths.
