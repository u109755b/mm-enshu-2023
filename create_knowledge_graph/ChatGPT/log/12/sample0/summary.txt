Alice blames the black kitten for the mischief with the worsted, as the white kitten was being washed by their mother, Dinah. While Alice attempts to wind the worsted again, she speaks to the kitten about the bonfire she watched being prepared and tells the kitten about her fictitious plans to punish it for its misbehavior. Alice pretends the kitten can play chess before imagining entering the Looking-Glass House, where everything is reversed. Through her imagination, Alice enters the Looking-Glass room, noticing the differences from her own room, such as living pictures and walking chessmen. She interacts with the Red King and Queen, the White King and Queen, and saves the White King from being dusty. Alice then reads a Looking-glass book and contemplates the nonsensical text before deciding to explore the rest of the house and the garden, inventing a new way to float down the stairs.
Alice struggles to navigate her way through a garden, attempting to reach a hill but constantly returns to the house. When she encounters lively, talking flowers — notably a Tiger-lily and Rose — they banter about their qualities and Alice's appearance. After meeting the Red Queen, who has grown much larger, the Queen helps Alice comprehend the garden's division into squares, revealing that it's set up like a chessboard. Alice is told she could become a Queen by reaching the eighth square. The chapter discusses concepts of movement and location in the garden, likening it to a giant chess game, and concludes with Alice preparing to make her next move as a Pawn in the game.
Alice explores a fantastical landscape, examining gigantic flowers that she initially believes are tended by bees, only to discover they are actually elephants. She decides to visit the insects later and continues her journey through this peculiar world by jumping over brooks. Confronted with the need for a train ticket, Alice encounters a range of talking creatures on the train, discussing absurd consequences of not having a name, such as missing lessons or being called 'Miss'. Meanwhile, Alice converses with a Gnat about various whimsical insects with unconventional characteristics and peculiar diets. Later, after a transition through more of the strange world, including an encounter with a fawn, Alice reflects on her name, the passage through the wood where things have no names, and the direction she should take, ultimately meeting two fat little men, Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
Alice encounters Tweedledum and Tweedledee, known from the embroidery on their collars, who jest with her about being alive or waxworks. Reciting a poem and not answering Alice's query about leaving the wood, they show her the Red King sleeping. They also argue over a broken rattle and gear up for a pretend battle. Before they start, a crow scares them away, and Alice considers the absurdity of the situation.
Alice helps the White Queen with her shawl and attempts to tidy her up, only to find the Queen's logic and approach to time and events to be confusing and backward. Despite Alice's efforts, the Queen remains untidy and nonsensical, even offering Alice a nonsensical job. The scene shifts to a shop where the Queen transforms into a sheep, and Alice finds herself rowing a boat and dealing with the fluid and changing environment of the shop that turns into a stream with scented rushes and then back to a shop again. Alice decides to buy an egg, which paradoxically seems to move further away the more she approaches it.
Alice encounters Humpty Dumpty sitting on a wall, who appears irritable about being called an egg. They discuss Humpty Dumpty's balance and safety, the meaning of names, and Alice's age. Humpty Dumpty offers philosophy on words and meanings, and on un-birthdays versus birthdays. He then critiques Alice's understanding of a cravat versus a belt. Humpty Dumpty goes on to explain the nonsensical poem "Jabberwocky" in detail and performs a self-written, prideful poem. Outraged by imagined disrespect, he brings the conversation to an abrupt end, leading Alice to walk away and hear a heavy crash.
Alice encounters the White King, who has sent his soldiers and horses through the forest and is counting them. She also meets the White King's messengers, Haigha and Hatta. The king and Alice discuss seeing "Nobody" on the road, and the king marvels at her ability to see such a distance. The King then sends for food after claiming to feel faint. A messenger arrives, out of breath, and delivers a ham sandwich to the king. When the king requests another sandwich, the messenger notes only hay is left. The messenger reports that the Lion and the Unicorn have resumed fighting for the king's crown, and they all go to watch. The fighters take a break for refreshments, during which Alice notes that the Unicorn and Lion seem friendly despite their battle. The White Queen is briefly mentioned as running quickly across the country, but the king dismisses any concern. The chapter ends with drums starting, likely signifying the end of the fight between the Lion and the Unicorn, and Alice feeling overwhelmed by the noise.
Alice, after the noise around her subsides, questions the reality of her experiences with the Lion, Unicorn, and Messengers, but confirms she wasn't dreaming when she sees a dish that she had used to cut plum-cake. She contemplates whether she's in her own dream or part of the Red King's dream. A Red Knight and a White Knight then successively claim Alice as their prisoner and prepare to fight for her. However, the bizarre combat, based on unique and whimsical rules, ends with both knights falling off their horses and the Red Knight leaving after they shake hands. The White Knight tells Alice that she will become a queen once she crosses the next brook.  The White Knight, oddly dressed and badly fitted in tin armor, shares with Alice his various quirky inventions, such as a box for carrying clothes and sandwiches upside-down to prevent rain from getting in (though it doesn't keep things from falling out), a plan to discourage bees from entering a mouse-trap attached to his saddle, and anklets on his horse to guard against shark bites. Despite his frequent falls from his horse and awkward ways, the White Knight depicts himself as a great inventor. As they journey together, he tells Alice of his peculiar inventions and theories, such as a plan to prevent his hair from falling off, a way of crossing gates, and a new pudding idea—none of which seem practical.  Towards the end of the wood, the White Knight recites a nonsensical song for Alice. After the song, as he prepares to leave, he requests Alice to wait and wave him off from a distance, believing it would encourage him. Alice obliges, and after witnessing the Knight tumble and recover multiple times, she waves her handkerchief to him before he goes out of sight. Alice then moves on, excited at the prospect of becoming a queen. As she reaches her destination and takes a rest, she discovers a golden crown on her head, puzzled at its sudden appearance.
Alice finds herself quickly adjusting to being a queen, though she struggles with the responsibilities and etiquette that come with the title. She interacts with the Red and White Queens, who question her knowledge and understanding of various subjects, often in nonsensical or paradoxical ways. Despite the absurdity, Alice attempts to maintain a conversation with them, but the more she engages, the more bewildering the discussions become. Ultimately, Alice experiences an overwhelming and chaotic feast with the Looking-Glass creatures that culminates in her disrupting the nonsensical proceedings by pulling the tablecloth, causing everything on the table to crash to the floor. The Red Queen transforms into a small doll-like figure, prompting Alice to threaten to shake her into a kitten.
Alice shook the Red Queen, who did not resist, but her face shrank, eyes grew larger and greener, and she continued to become shorter, fatter, softer, and rounder.
Alice discovers that the creature she wakes up with is actually a kitten.
Alice reflects on her dream and discusses it with her kittens, playfully attributing roles of characters from the dream to them. She ponders whether it was she or the Red King who truly dreamt the Looking-Glass world, while the kittens continue their usual behavior, indifferent to her questions. The chapter closes with a poem likening life to a dream.
