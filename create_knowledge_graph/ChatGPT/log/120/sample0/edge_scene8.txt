Mr. Arrow, Squire Trelawney, friendship, He and the squire were very thick and friendly.
Mr. Trelawney, Captain Smollett, disagreement, Things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain.
Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, interruption; concurrence; judgment of character, But here Dr. Livesey cut in. “Far too much,” agreed the doctor. "I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and John Silver."
Captain Smollett, Mr. Trelawney, disapproval of the cruise; threat of resignation, I don’t like this cruise; I don’t like the men; and I don’t like my officer. "Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign."
Dr. Livesey, Captain Smollett, request for explanation; agreement; acknowledgment of secrecy; strategic planning, I’m bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. “No,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t.” Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don’t like treasure voyages on any account, and I don’t like them, above all, when they are secret. "You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend’s own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board."
Captain Smollett, Mr. Arrow, evaluation, I believe he’s a good seaman, but he’s too free with the crew to be a good officer.
Captain Smollett, Long John Silver, authority, "My orders!" said the captain shortly. “You may go below, my man. Hands will want supper."
