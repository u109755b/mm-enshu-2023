The passage describes the arrival of an old seaman known as the captain at the Admiral Benbow inn, owned by the narrator's father. With an air of authority and a secretive demeanor, the captain takes up long-term residence, insisting on privacy and often singing sea songs while drinking rum. Intriguingly, he pays the narrator to watch for a seafaring man with one leg, a figure that haunts the narrator's dreams. Despite the captain's rough manners, intimidating stories, and occasional threats, the locals are oddly captivated by his presence. Dr. Livesey, a local doctor and magistrate, confronts the captain's misbehavior one evening, warning him to behave or face legal repercussions. The captain, while upset, does not retaliate and remains quiet afterwards.
A mysterious stranger, missing two fingers and carrying a cutlass, arrives at an inn during a cold winter while the innkeeper's father's health is failing. The stranger, who has a sea-air but doesn’t seem completely sailor-like, asks for the captain, also known as Bill, who happens to be a guest at the inn, and begins a conversation with him over rum. The talk turns violent; they fight, and the stranger, named Black Dog, flees after being wounded by the captain. The captain then suffers a stroke and is treated by Doctor Livesey, who warns that continuing to drink rum could be fatal.
The ailing captain, in his final hours, pleads with young Jim for rum, offering a bribe and revealing his fears of being marked by the black spot—a pirate's death threat—because of a treasure known only to him. Despite health risks, Jim fetches the rum. The captain fears retribution from his old crew and makes Jim promise to warn the authorities if necessary. Later, a blind beggar arrives, coercing Jim to lead him to the captain, ultimately delivering the dreaded black spot before hastily departing. The captain, realizing his time is limited, attempts to rise but succumbs to a fatal apoplexy, leaving Jim with a sense of unexpected sorrow.
A mother and her son, Jim, find themselves in a dangerous predicament after the death of a man owing them money, and with menacing characters like Black Dog and a blind beggar potentially posing a threat. They resolve to seek help and retrieve what's owed to them. Despite their bravery and the mother's impassioned speech to the villagers, no one assists them in defending their inn, the Admiral Benbow. Jim and his mother return to the inn alone, find the key on the dead man's body, and open his sea-chest to claim what is rightfully theirs. As they count the money, the scary blind man's tapping approaches but fades away, providing them the chance to flee. They escape with the money and a packet of papers from the chest but face the peril of being pursued as they head towards the hamlet. The mother, overcome with weakness, nearly collapses, and Jim helps her to hide under a bridge while they remain in danger.
A group of men, led by a blind man named Pew, arrived at the Admiral Benbow inn searching for a hidden chest. Despite their aggressive search, they found nothing; they had been beaten to it. As they quarreled amongst themselves, they were interrupted by approaching danger signaled by a whistle. The men scattered, leaving Pew behind, who was subsequently killed accidentally by a horse. The narrator, possibly in possession of what Pew's crew was searching for, decided to seek safety with the assistance of revenue officers who arrived, led by a supervisor named Dance. The inn was left in disarray from the search, and the narrator planned to report the events to Dr. Livesey with Mr. Dance's support.
Riding swiftly to Dr. Livesey's house, the group finds he's at the squire's hall. They hurry there and inform the squire and Dr. Livesey about the assailants at the inn and their search for Billy Bones' papers. Jim Hawkins presents the packet he retrieved, which contains a book and a map, possibly revealing the location of Captain Flint's treasure. Excited, the squire decides to finance a voyage to find the treasure, with Dr. Livesey as the ship’s doctor and Jim as the cabin boy, planning to keep the discovery secret as others are likely seeking the same fortune.
The preparations for setting sail took longer than expected, with Dr. Livesey having to go to London, the squire working hard in Bristol, and the narrator waiting at the hall, full of excitement about upcoming adventures at sea. Despite delays and difficulty finding a crew, Squire Trelawney secured the schooner Hispaniola in Bristol and engaged Long John Silver as the cook, who then helped recruit a capable crew. The squire sent a letter detailing these developments and urging Dr. Livesey to hurry to Bristol. The narrator shared the excitement caused by the letter and his mixed feelings upon leaving home for an adventurous journey at sea. The crew was ready, and they prepared to sail the following day.
A young boy, having finished breakfast, is given a note for John Silver and finds the Spy-glass tavern where seafaring men gather. John Silver, the one-legged, affable landlord, mistakes the boy for a new cabin-boy. When a patron identified as Black Dog flees without paying, Silver sends his men after him. Despite suspicions around Silver's possible pirate connections, the boy is convinced of his innocence. After sharing laughter, Silver and the boy head to meet the squire and Dr. Livesey, who are planning an inspection of a schooner. Silver recounts the events involving Black Dog truthfully, leaving a good impression on the gentlemen, and they all agree to meet aboard the ship later that day. The squire and the doctor express trust in Silver's character, and the boy is invited to join them to see the ship.
The Hispaniola prepares for a voyage, but Captain Smollett is displeased with several aspects: his lack of control over choosing the crew, the nature of the secret treasure mission, and the conduct of his officer, Mr. Arrow. He confronts Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey about these issues and suggests strategic changes regarding the storage of arms and the crew's berths to prevent potential mutiny. The squire and the doctor agree to Smollett's recommendations, although Trelawney expresses disdain for the captain's manner. As weapons and supplies are being rearranged, Long John Silver makes his appearance. Smollett maintains strict discipline, showing no favoritism, which causes the narrator to dislike the captain.
Preparations were made for a voyage with the squire's friends bidding farewell. After setting sail, the Hispaniola had a fairly good journey, though the first mate, Mr. Arrow, turned out to be a drunkard and eventually went overboard, leading to the promotion of the boatswain, Job Anderson. Long John Silver, the ship's cook, was well-respected and had a unique relationship with his parrot, which he called Cap'n Flint. Meanwhile, there was tension between the squire and Captain Smollett, who had doubts about the crew but liked the ship. Good spirits were maintained with treats like double grog and apples. Eventually, it became clear that an apple barrel on board was crucial for a warning about an act of treachery. As they neared their destination, the narrator hid in the nearly empty apple barrel and overheard Silver's conversation, realizing the fate of the crew rested on his shoulders.
Long John Silver reminisces about his piracy days and his plans for future wealth, boasting to a young crew member about his cunning and strategy for survival. He emphasizes the importance of thrift and planning over recklessness. Silver displays confidence in his abilities and contemplates his retirement. The crew discusses their dissatisfaction with their current captain and their desire to claim their share of treasure. The group, which includes pirate cohorts like Israel Hands, plans to use the ship's officers to locate the treasure before turning on them. Throughout their conversation, they drink and toast to their past and future endeavors, unaware that they are being overheard by an eavesdropper hiding in a barrel, who learns of remaining loyal crew members and of the mutineers' intentions.
Aboard the ship Hispaniola, there is sudden activity as the crew prepares for an impending encounter. Captain Smollett strategically maneuvers the ship near Skeleton Island, previously known for pirates, while questioning the crew about their knowledge of the land. Long John Silver openly shares his familiarity with the island, fooling Captain Smollett with a copied but incomplete map. Afterward, Silver privately, but menacingly, confides in Jim Hawkins about his experiences on the island, leaving Jim uneasy. Jim then desperately seeks to share with the captain and his allies critical information he has overheard about Silver's treacherous intentions. With this knowledge, the captain acknowledges they're surrounded by an untrustworthy crew, likely planning a mutiny. They decide to maintain control and keep watch until they can identify their loyal crew members and act preemptively. Out of the twenty-six crew, only seven are deemed trustworthy, including Jim, whose observant nature is seen as an asset.
My Shore Adventure began with a changed island landscape and calm weather. Despite being a seasoned sailor, I felt uneasy on the still ship and disliked the island's dreary appearance. We had to warp the HISPANIOLA around the island without wind, in sweltering heat with discontent growing among the crew. As we anchored, the ominous presence of fever and potential mutiny loomed. The captain's plan was to let the crew ashore, hoping to quell their unrest. Armed and wary, the crew's morale briefly lifted at the promise of shore leave. With the crew divided, I impulsively stowed away on a boat headed to shore, evading notice until too late. Landing amidst the woods, I fled into the foliage, leaving Silver calling after me.
After successfully evading Long John Silver, the narrator finds joy in exploring the uninhabited island. Hearing some of his shipmates approaching by a marsh, he hides and eavesdrops on Silver conversing with another crew member, Tom. Silver tries to convince Tom of his loyalty, but they are interrupted by a distant scream. A confrontation ensues, and Silver kills Tom following an altercation over a perceived betrayal. The narrator, witnessing the murder, flees in fear, aware that discovery could mean his own death at the hands of the mutineers. As he runs, the narrator contemplates his grim options—starvation or being killed by the crew.
While traversing a stony area, the narrator observes a mysterious figure and initially opts for known dangers over the uncertain threat of this stranger. This figure turns out to be a man named Ben Gunn, isolated for three years after being marooned. Ben Gunn longs for a return to civilization and Christian fellowship, as well as for cheese. He expresses a peculiar mix of madness, piety, and slyness, revealing to the narrator that he knows the location of Captain Flint's treasure. Ben Gunn had been part of Flint's crew and witnessed the hiding of the treasure. He offers to ally with the narrator, showing interest in securing a share of the treasure and safe passage home. Their conversation is interrupted by the sound of gunfire, signaling that a conflict has begun, and they hurry toward the action.
The doctor continued narrating how their ship, the HISPANIOLA, was abandoned. At approximately 1:30 pm, they considered attacking the mutineers on board due to their diminished number. However, they lacked wind for maneuvering and learned Jim Hawkins had gone ashore. Concerned for Jim's safety, the doctor and Hunter took a boat to shore for reconnaissance. They stealthily approached the stockade—a fortified log house with a strategic water spring—and returned to the ship to devise a plan to transport supplies to the stockade. They successfully moved firearms, food, and the doctor's medicine chest to the stockade, making multiple trips despite risks from the shore. The doctor returned to the ship for the last time, with the squire waiting to load more supplies. They discarded unnecessary weapons overboard and prepared to leave. As they were leaving, Captain Smollett convinced one of the mutineers, Abraham Gray, to join them. They then departed the ship for their fortified position.
The overburdened jolly-boat, carrying five men and supplies, faced peril from an ebbing tide that took them off course. The captain directed the crew to correct their imbalance, as they navigated a tricky current away from nearby pirates. Steering proved difficult, and they had to avoid coming ashore too close to the enemy or risk getting swept past their landing point. During their escape, they realized the pirates could potentially use a long gun left onshore against them. As they approached safety, they narrowly avoided gunfire from the hostile crew and were forced to act quickly as the opposing gigs closed in. Despite making headway, their boat sank gently in shallow water due to an ill-timed shot, causing them to lose most of their supplies but sparing their lives. Voices nearby signaled further danger as they contemplated the defense capabilities of their comrades at the stockade, and they hastened to wade ashore amidst these threats.
The group advances towards the stockade but encounters mutineers, leading to a skirmish in which one enemy is killed and Tom Redruth, a member of the group, is fatally wounded. After celebrating their victory, the group faces another attack but manages to fend it off. They hoist the British flag, but the mutineers continue to bombard them without success. Despite the ongoing assault, the group is able to acknowledge Redruth's bravery before he passes away. The captain takes stock of their supplies and notes that they're low. Meanwhile, Silver and the mutineers steal their supplies, leaving the group with limited provisions. Suddenly, Jim Hawkins appears, having safely returned to the group.
Ben Gunn and Jim Hawkins discuss the likelihood of their friends being at a nearby stockade. They part ways when cannon fire begins. Jim hides, observing activity around the anchored ship Hispaniola, recognizing the pirate flag. He considers Ben Gunn's hints about a boat's location. Returning to the stockate, Jim finds his group managing after the attack, burying a comrade, and strategizing for survival against the pirates' superior numbers. They hope to outlast the pirates with the help of rum and disease as allies. Later, a flag of truce appears, and to Jim's shock, Silver himself arrives.
John Silver, accompanied by another man, approaches the stockade under a flag of truce to negotiate with Captain Smollett. Despite the cold and damp morning, Silver is confident and attempts to make terms for his safe departure and a share of treasure, but the captain steadfastly refuses any discussion, insisting on bringing the mutineers to justice. The tension is palpable, with both sides aware of the other's capabilities and intentions. Silver, rebuffed and angry, threatens retaliation before he is assisted back over the stockade, leaving the captain and his loyal crew prepared to defend themselves.
After observing a tense standoff where the captain criticized his men for not being at their posts, Captain Smollett fortified the blockhouse and prepared his crew for the imminent attack by pirates. Tensions rose as they waited in the heat, and eventually the pirates assaulted the blockhouse, with initial musket fire followed by a direct charge. Despite being outnumbered, the defenders managed to repel the first wave of the attack, suffering some casualties in the process. The captain was wounded, and the battle’s outcome left them in a slightly better position as the number of active mutineers diminished.
After a fight, only three wounded men named Hunter, Captain Smollett, and a mutineer were alive, with Smollett expected to recover. The narrator envies Dr. Livesey, who left on an errand, suspected to meet Ben Gunn, and decides to embark on his own risky adventure. He steals biscuits and arms himself with pistols and plans to find Ben Gunn's hidden boat. He successfully finds the boat, a small handmade craft, and contemplates his next move: to release the anchored pirate ship, the Hispaniola, to strand the mutineers. As night falls, he prepares to execute his plan under the cover of darkness and fog.
The narrator recounts navigating a small, stubborn boat called a coracle toward a ship, the HISPANIOLA, using the tide to compensate for its poor handling. Despite challenges with the boat and deciding against cutting the ship's anchor, the narrator manages to get close to the vessel, overhearing drunken and angry voices from within. As the coracle reaches the ship, a confrontation aboard the HISPANIOLA distracts the watchmen, and the narrator witnesses a violent struggle between two men. The current shifts, carrying the coracle and the ship out toward the open sea, and the narrator prepares for what seems like an inevitable fatal outcome, eventually falling asleep in the bobbing vessel, dreaming of home.
A man wakes up in a small boat near Treasure Island, contemplates landing but deems the cliffs and sea lions too dangerous. He decides to paddle towards a more inviting cape, battling waves and gaining confidence in maneuvering his coracle. He spots the ship HISPANIOLA sailing erratically and realizes no one is at the helm. He pursues the ship, braving the rough sea, until he manages to board the seemingly deserted vessel after a dangerous and strenuous chase.
After gaining his footing on the ship during rough sailing conditions, the narrator finds himself alone on deck, encountering the badly injured Israel Hands and the dead body of another crewman, prompting him to seek brandy for Hands and provisions for himself. He successfully negotiates with Hands to sail the ship to a safer location, takes command of the vessel, lowers the pirate flag, and tends to Hands' wound with a handkerchief. With his new authority and improved spirits, they manage to navigate the ship closer to land as the narrator reflects on his actions and the suspicious behavior of Hands.
Israel Hands and the narrator, Jim Hawkins, are aboard the HISPANIOLA with Hands suggesting Jim throw the dead body of O'Brien overboard. Jim refuses, and they discuss the nature of death and spirits. Hands, pretending to want wine, tries to lure Jim away, ostensibly to fetch it. Jim, suspecting a trap, prepares to defend himself. Hands, secretly arming himself while pretending to be weak, attempts to attack Jim. They engage in a dangerous maneuver to beach the ship, with Jim narrowly escaping Hands’ attack by using quick thinking and agility. As the ship runs aground, both men are thrown into disarray, but Jim manages to outmaneuver Hands and gain the upper hand with loaded pistols. After a tense negotiation, Hands tries to surprise Jim but fails, resulting in his own fall into the water.
After witnessing the death of Hands and O'Brien and narrowly escaping with his life, the protagonist managed to tend to his injuries and secure the ship, the Hispaniola, from any remaining threats. He then ensures the safety of the ship by cutting the main-sail and makes his escape, wading ashore as the tide recedes. He sets off toward the stockade, reflecting on his adventures and anticipating the pride he'll take in telling his tale. However, as night falls, traveling becomes difficult, and the protagonist proceeds with caution. Upon nearing the stockade, he finds it strangely quiet, with a large fire indicating something amiss. Entering carefully, he is reassured to hear his companions snoring but criticizes their poor watch. When he accidentally announces his presence, Silver's parrot, Captain Flint, squawks loudly, awakening the men, leading to the protagonist's capture by Silver’s crew.
The protagonist, Jim Hawkins, finds himself in the blockhouse among the pirates who have taken control. The group includes the wounded man from the previous attack and Long John Silver with his parrot. Silver, appearing battle-worn but composed, talks to Jim in a seemingly friendly manner, despite the precarious situation. Jim silently observes as Silver tells how his group lost the ship after a negotiation with Dr. Livesey. Although Jim’s friends were safe and he was being offered a chance to join the pirates, he bravely confronts Silver, claiming responsibility for their misfortunes, from overhearing their plans to his direct actions against them. Silver admires Jim’s courage and commands his crew's respect, defying anyone to challenge him. As the crew leaves for a private council, Silver confides in Jim that they are both in danger but proposes mutual support. Jim tentatively agrees, recognizing their fates are intertwined. Silver then questions Jim about the chart and the doctor’s intent, concluding there must be more to the situation as he braces for additional trouble.
The buccaneers convened, and John Silver was presented with the black spot, signaling his deposal as captain. They accused him of mishandling their quest, but Silver eloquently defended himself, managing to retain support from his crew. The meeting concluded with Silver avoiding immediate repercussion and assigning George Merry as sentinel. Meanwhile, I struggled with my own dangerous predicament, Silver’s crafty tactics, and my conscience over a recent killing, while Silver seemingly slept without worry despite his precarious situation.
Dr. Livesey visits the blockhouse to treat the sick pirates, exhibiting confidence and control despite the danger. Silver, maintaining authority over the mutinous crew, negotiates with Livesey, allowing him to speak with Jim Hawkins outside the stockade. During their conversation, Silver displays vulnerability about his predicament. Jim reveals to Livesey the ship's hidden location, prompting a discussion of the dire situation and future risks. Livesey offers Silver hope and protection in exchange for keeping Jim safe. He departs to seek further assistance, leaving Silver and Jim in a tense situation with the pirates.
Silver and Jim discuss their mutual life-saving actions and plan to stick together during the treasure hunt. The crew is carelessly wasting food and Silver is the de facto leader, instilling confidence in his men regarding the treasure quest and control of the ship. Jim is anxious about the pirates’ recklessness and Silver's double-dealing nature. Despite Silver's alliances, there's fear about the outcome if the crew's trust in him falters. The expedition for Flint's treasure begins with a lively departure but turns tense when discovering a skeleton positioned as a pointer towards the treasure, evoking dread of Flint's ghost among the men.
While the party rests, Silver takes compass bearings, and the pirates are spooked by a mysterious voice singing "Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest.” Initially feared to be the ghost of Flint, the voice is revealed to be Ben Gunn’s. Their spirits lifted, they ignore Dick's growing illness and press on. They reach a thicket and find that the treasure has already been excavated and stolen, confirmed by the presence of the name WALRUS on a board from Flint's ship.
After a tense confrontation between Silver and the mutineers over gold, shots fire from an ambush by the doctor and others, causing the mutineers to flee. Silver and Jim then join the doctor and head to the boats, with Silver working hard despite his exhaustion. They learn Ben Gunn had found the treasure long ago, and they maneuver to protect it. Eventually, they reach the safety of the anchored Hispaniola and celebrate their hard-won success, acknowledging the heavy costs of their adventure.
The group is engaged in the laborious task of moving a large hoard of treasure to their ship, the Hispaniola, while keeping an eye on the remaining mutineers on the island. As they continue their work, they encounter various challenges and interactions with the mutineers. They ultimately decide to abandon the mutineers on the island, leaving them supplies and sailing away. During their escape, one of the mutineers shoots at them, but they leave without further incident. They reach a Spanish port, where part of the crew goes ashore and experiences a pleasant evening. Later, they learn that Silver has escaped with a portion of the treasure. The crew returns to Bristol with a fraction of its original members, and each person goes on to lead their own life post-adventure, with varying outcomes based on their choices and desires. Silver's eventual fate remains unknown, and the bulk of the treasure remains buried on the island.
