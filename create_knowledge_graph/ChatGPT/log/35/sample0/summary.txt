The Time Traveller presents his theory of the fourth dimension, Time, to his dinner guests, challenging conventional ideas about geometry and existence. He explains that just as the three spatial dimensions are essential for the existence of objects, so is duration or time. The guests are skeptical but intrigued, with some attempting to grasp the concept and others dismissing it as implausible. Despite their doubts, the Time Traveller claims to have experimental evidence and hints at having built a machine capable of time travel, before leaving the room. His departure piques the curiosity of the guests, leading to speculation about his experiment's nature.
The Time Traveller presented a small, intricate machine to his guests, claiming it could travel through time. He demonstrated it to a skeptical group, made up of the Psychologist, the Medical Man, the Provincial Mayor, and others, who closely observed the machine and its operation without noticing any trickery. The machine then vanished from sight after the Psychologist was invited to activate it. The Time Traveller asserted the disappearance was genuine, explained the concept using psychology, and offered to show the larger, nearly completed version of the machine in his laboratory. Despite the demonstration and explanation, the guests seemed incredulous but curious.
The narrator recounts skepticism around the Time Traveller's claims about time travel, suspecting his ingenuity rather than taking him seriously. At a gathering, the Time Traveller arrives disheveled and disturbed but withholds his story until he has eaten. Addressing the group's doubts and questions, he agrees to recount his remarkable experiences without interruption, though his tale sounds unbelievable. He claims to have lived eight extraordinary days since 4 pm that day.
Summary: The narrator describes testing his Time Machine, experiencing a harrowing and disorienting journey through time, witnessing the rapid alternation of days and nights, and the changing landscape. Upon stopping the machine, he finds himself in a future garden with unfamiliar architecture and encounters a group of small, delicate human-like beings after a moment of panic and struggle with his machine.
The narrator meets a group of delicate, childlike creatures in the future who express curiosity but no fear. They communicate in a melodic language and are fascinated by the Time Machine. The narrator attempts to prevent them from tampering with the machine and explores methods of communication, finding their intelligence level much lower than expected. He is adorned with flowers as a sign of affection and led to a building where he observes the simple and vegetarian lifestyle of these future beings. He begins to learn their language, though they tire easily and lose interest in teaching him.
The narrator observes a lack of interest from the future humans, comparing their fleeting attention to that of children. After leaving a building and satisfying hunger, the narrator resolves to explore and understand the changed world, noticing various ruins and lack of small houses, speculating about the societal structure. Observing a uniformity in the future humans' appearance and clothing, the narrator theorizes about the absence of traditional gender roles and family structures, attributing this to a world where physical strength is no longer necessary. The world appears to be a perfectly maintained garden without signs of struggle or disease. This leads the narrator to contemplate the possibility of humanity's decline due to the lack of challenge and hardship, which once drove human development and adaptation. The narrator reflects on the triumphs over nature and ponders the consequences of such a utopia, where even the artistic spirit has nearly vanished, suggesting an ultimate contentment leading to stagnation. The narrator's initial interpretation sees the explanations as simple, yet realizes they may be incorrect or incomplete.
In the story, the protagonist is struck with fear and desperation when he realizes his Time Machine is missing. He frantically searches for it near the White Sphinx, where it was last seen, but to no avail. The Time Machine has vanished, and the protagonist is left to come to terms with his new reality in this strange world. He contemplates the idea that it has been hidden by some unknown power and grapples with the loss of his connection to his own time. Eventually, he resolves to stay calm and consider various plans, including building a new machine or finding the original one. His interactions with the little people are fraught with misunderstanding, and his actions driven by desperation lead to no success in recovering the Time Machine. He decides to adapt to his new surroundings, learn the language of the people there, and patiently wait for a solution to present itself, resigning himself to the irony of his situation.
The traveler describes a lush, vibrant world with abundant buildings and life, yet also mysterious wells no water but rhythmic thumping and air currents. Suspecting a subterranean ventilation system unrelated to sanitation, he realizes the less sophisticated lifestyle of the inhabitants differs from expected futures or utopias. Noticing no elderly people and no signs of industry, he contemplates the sustainability of their society. After his Time Machine is taken, he forms a friendly bond with Weena, an Eloi, and learns of their fear of darkness. He discovers Morlocks, a nocturnal underground species, hypothesizing they evolved from humans to operate machinery maintaining the Eloi's lifestyle. The traveler theorizes that class divisions drove humanity into two separate species: the privileged Eloi and laboring Morlocks. He questions the Morlocks' intentions and why the Eloi can't help recover his Machine, while Weena is disturbed by the subject.
The narrator took two days before deciding to investigate the Morlocks, influenced by the Eloi's disgust for them. Disturbed by fear and a sense of duty, he discovered a green structure with an Oriental look but postponed exploring it. The next day, he resolved to descend into the Morlocks' underground domain, despite feeling dread and loneliness. Weena, an Eloi, accompanied him to the well but became distressed when he began his descent. The narrator struggled down the shaft, cramped and at one point nearly falling. Once inside, he rested and encountered three Morlocks who fled from the light of his matches. He observed that Morlocks were carnivorous and lived in a vast cavern with machinery. The narrator used his matches sparingly after realizing he had only a few left. The Morlocks attempted to physically overwhelm him in the dark, but he managed to escape back to the tunnel and eventually the surface after a harrowing climb up the shaft, feeling ill and exhausted. He passed out amidst the comforting presence of Weena and other Eloi.
The Time Traveller feels despair as he contemplates his situation among the Eloi and the Morlocks, realizing the complexity and danger he faces with the latter's antagonistic nature. His hope of escape diminishes with his understanding of the evolved social dynamics between the two species, with the Morlocks preying on the Eloi. Facing these challenges, he resolves to create weapons and find a secure place to sleep. He carries Weena, an Eloi who fears the dark, and they travel toward the Palace of Green Porcelain, which he considers a potential haven. Along the journey, they encounter various obstacles, and the Time Traveller reflects on the fate of humanity, the nature of fear, and the passage of time while seeking solace in the stars. He ponders the Morlocks' food source, realizing the horrific truth, and attempts to rationalize the current state of human devolution. His plan includes creating weapons, finding a means to produce fire, breaking into the Sphinx to retrieve his Time Machine, and possibly bringing Weena back with him.
The narrator discovers the Palace of Green Porcelain, an ancient museum in a state of decay. Inside, he finds porcelain, inscriptions, fossils, and remnants of various exhibits that hint at past intellectual achievements. He ponders the use and significance of the objects encountered, particularly when finding matches and camphor, which are useful for protection against the Morlocks. Throughout his exploration, he searches for means to protect himself and Weena, considering various tools and weapons he finds among the exhibits, and plans to spend the night near a fire for safety. He maintains hope of regaining his Time Machine despite the advancing night and the threats posed by the Morlocks.
The narrator traverses a dark forest at night with Weena, gathering wood and fearing attack by Morlocks, an underground species. Weena becomes tired, and when darkness falls, the Morlocks attack. The narrator uses matches for protection but struggles to keep the fire going. Eventually, Weena faints or dies, and the narrator becomes disoriented while fending off the Morlocks. A forest fire starts, confusing and repelling the Morlocks, and in its light, the narrator escapes, leaving behind the Morlocks and Weena. He returns to his Time Machine, feeling alone and overwhelmed by Weena's death, and reflects on his experiences in the future world compared to the familiarity of his own time and home.
The narrator reflects on the unchanged beauty of the world from his first arrival and the painful memory of Weena. The complacency of the Overworld people is contrasted with the industriousness of the Underworld. Surmising the collapse of the perfect state and the Morlocks' return to old feeding habits, the narrator theorizes on the role of intelligence in survival. After resting by the White Sphinx, he finds the Time Machine unguarded and realizes the Morlocks have tampered with it. Upon entering the machine, he is trapped but eventually escapes, fighting off the Morlocks and engaging the machine to return to his original time.
The time traveler narrates his disoriented experience with time travel, arriving in the distant future where day and night cycles slow down, and the Earth comes to a standstill with one side facing the sun. The sun appears large and red, life as we know it has vanished, and new monstrous forms of life, resembling large crabs, have emerged. The environment is desolate with red skies, green vegetation in perpetual twilight, and a silent, dead sea. Eventually, the traveler witnesses a significant chill and signs of an advancing ice age, with snow and ice encroaching. During an eclipse, the traveler speculates he might have seen the transit of an inner planet rather than the moon, before an overwhelming darkness and cold prompt him to return to his own time.
The Time Traveller returns to his laboratory after a period of insensibility on the machine. He witnesses the reversal of time as he approaches his original time, seeing people and scenery moving backward. He stops the machine feeling shaky and notices the lab looking the same but the machine's displacement reveals the physical journey undertaken. Taking time to recover from his disorientation, he realizes he has returned to the present day when he sees current newspapers and hears familiar voices, leading him to join his companions for dinner and recount his experiences.
The Time Traveller shares his incredible adventures with a group of disbelieving friends, asking them to accept his story as either truth or fiction. Despite their skepticism, signaled by their various distractions and dismissals, the Traveller maintains that his adventures were real, evidenced by the strange flowers and his own scars. After examining the flowers, the Medical Man expresses doubt, and the Editor suggests the Traveller should be a writer. The Traveller later shows unease about the reality of his experiences and checks his Time Machine to confirm its existence. His abrupt departure and discussions about time travel with the narrator precede another mysterious disappearance, leaving behind a broken skylight and no sign of his return. The narrator reflects on the Traveller's potential whereabouts across various times and ponders the future of mankind, with only withered flowers and memories of the story as comfort. The Time Traveller has been missing for three years, and the narrator is left to wonder if he will ever return.
