My little hosts, Me, display astonishment, They would come to me with eager cries of astonishment.
I, Men of the future, meeting, I was continually meeting more of these men of the future.
Men of the future, Me, follow and communicate, Men of the future would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me.
People of the future, Children, appear similar, And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents.
Men of the future, Women of the future, lack differentiation, In costume, and in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike.
