All children grow up, except for one. Peter Pan is mentioned as a mysterious boy connected to the Darling family, particularly the children: Wendy, John, and Michael. Their nurse is a Newfoundland dog named Nana. The Darling children's minds are filled with thoughts of Peter Pan, a boy who is said to live with the fairies and never grows up. One night, Mrs. Darling dreams of the Neverland and wakes to find Peter Pan in the nursery, recognized by her from the kiss he resembles that she carries in her own being.
Mrs. Darling discovers the shadow of a boy who leapt out the window, thinking he was harmed. Nana, the dog nurse, captured the shadow, and Mrs. Darling stored it away. A week later, haunted by that fateful Friday when misadventures occurred, Mr. and Mrs. Darling lament various decisions like pouring medicine, accepting a dinner invitation, and having Nana as a nurse. The night of the party, Mr. Darling struggles with his tie and, after dealing with a medicine-related ruse, confines Nana to the yard. The children are unsettled, sensing danger as the parents leave for the party. Unbeknownst to them, stars watch, awaiting Peter's cue to commence their adventures.
Peter Pan visits the Darling children's nursery after they are left alone. The night-lights go out and Tinker Bell, a fairy, searches for Peter's shadow. Peter arrives, but cannot reattach his shadow. Wendy wakes up and helps him, leading to a friendly conversation where she learns about Peter, the lost boys, and Neverland. Peter is drawn to Wendy's storytelling abilities and invites her to Neverland to tell stories to the lost boys. Wendy is tempted by the adventure and agrees to go with Peter, who promises to teach them to fly. Peter sprinkles them with fairy dust, and after some initial difficulty, the children learn to fly. Just as they are about to leave, Mr. and Mrs. Darling reach the nursery too late; the children and Peter have already flown away towards Neverland.
Wendy and the boys follow Peter Pan's whimsical directions toward Neverland, experiencing both the joys and dangers of flying. Peter's carefree attitude toward danger alarms Wendy, especially when he waits until the last second to save the falling boys. They playfully interact with sea creatures, but struggle with flying mechanics and miss having a guiding hand to help steady them. When they finally sight Neverland, the children are thrilled and familiar sights invoke personal memories. However, fear overtakes them as darkness approaches and they become aware of the island's more threatening side. Peter's leadership through hostile invisible forces becomes evident, and they encounter the reality of pirates and the infamous Captain Hook. Tinker Bell, jealous of Wendy, lures her to danger as they all tumble into the true adventures of Neverland.
Peter Pan returns to Neverland, reviving its usual activities. The inhabitants—lost boys, pirates, and natives—cycle around the island, each group hunting the other. The lost boys wear bear skins and remain on alert. Each boy is characterized: Tootles is unlucky, Nibs is cheerful, Slightly is conceited, Curly is a troublemaker, and the twins are indistinguishable. Pirate Captain Hook and his crew are on the trail of the boys, singing menacingly. Hook is distinguished by his elegance, iron hook, and fear of a crocodile that swallowed a ticking clock. The boys hide underground, worrying about Peter and discussing their vague memories of mothers. Hook plans to leave a poisoned cake to kill the boys. As the pirates prepare their trap, the ticking crocodile approaches, sending Hook and Smee running away. Nibs brings news of a mysterious white bird, which Tinker Bell, out of jealousy, convinces the boys to shoot down, believing it's what Peter desires. Tootles shoots the bird, which is revealed to be Wendy, who falls with an arrow in her chest.
Tootles mistakenly shoots Wendy with an arrow, thinking she was a bird, and the boys believe she is dead. They grieve but are interrupted by the sound of Peter Pan's return. Peter is initially unaware of the tragedy and proudly announces he brought a mother (Wendy) for the boys, only to find her apparently lifeless. Tootles admits to shooting the arrow, and as Peter contemplates punishing him, they discover Wendy is still alive, saved by the button Peter had given her. Despite her near-death experience, Wendy accepts the role of mother for the boys and they quickly construct a small house around her. Peter orders various tasks to make Wendy comfortable, including fetching a pretend doctor to tend to her. Wendy wakes up, accepts her new role as the boys' mother, and they celebrate the newly built house. Peter then guards the house and the children as they all settle into their new life, with the evening ending in the cozy, safe little house, watched over by Peter.
Peter measures Wendy, John, and Michael for trees that will fit them perfectly for travel in the underground home; Wendy and Michael fit on the first try while John needs adjustments. The home is described as a large room with a floor used for fishing, mutable furniture, and a fireplace, with a bed for the boys and a basket for little Michael. Wendy spends her time sewing and caring for the boys, making new clothes and repairing worn ones, while Peter and the boys have nightly adventures and play new games. Time passes differently in Neverland, and although Wendy does not worry about her parents, she tries to make sure the boys remember their past lives. The narrative struggles to choose which of the many adventures to recount, finally settling on the story of the lagoon.
The Mermaids' Lagoon is an enchanted place visited by Peter Pan, Wendy, and the other children, where they swim with mermaids, play games, and rest. Though they interact with mermaids, Wendy never manages to befriend them, as they often flee or act dismissively towards the humans. The mermaids can be seen during full moons, and they play with bubbles made in rainbow-colored water. One day, as the children rest, the atmosphere changes from delightful to ominous, signaling impending danger. Peter, who can detect threats even while asleep, warns the group just as pirates approach. Tiger Lily, captured by the pirates, is to be left on a rock but is saved by Peter impersonating Captain Hook. Hook, planning to capture Wendy and make her the pirates' mother, grows frustrated after the children's unexpected escape. A battle ensues between the pirates and the children, leaving Peter and Wendy stranded on a shrinking rock. As they face their possible doom, a kite appears, and Peter uses it to save Wendy, leaving himself alone to face his fears and the rising waters with bravery.
Peter is left alone, hearing mermaids retreat to their underwater chambers, when he notices the Never bird struggling to reach him as the waters rise. The bird, determined to save Peter, offers her nest to help him drift ashore, despite containing eggs. Initially, they don't understand each other, but after the bird's persistent efforts, Peter grasps her plan. Using the nest, Peter sails across the lagoon while the Never bird secures her eggs on Starkey's floating hat. Later, Peter and the lost boys return home late, delaying bedtime with their tales and demands, while Wendy ensures everyone is cared for after their adventures.
Peter's alliance with the redskins makes them protective allies, watching over the Lost Boys' underground home and standing by for a pirate attack. Peter enjoys being revered as the "Great White Father" by the redskins, a sentiment that Wendy quietly disapproves of, believing it to be unfitting.  The children's routine evening is punctuated by playful disputes and Wendy's attempts to maintain order, emphasizing her maternal role. An evening of pretend festivities ensues as Peter brings back nuts and the correct time, and the group prepares for a dance in their nightgowns, pretending it's Saturday night.  As the story progresses, the characters' make-believe family dynamics are highlighted, with Peter pondering his pretend role as their father and the children's desire for a mother figure. Wendy and Peter share a tender moment discussing their familial bond, while Tinker Bell's jealousy and playful banter are evident.  Their final night on the island, unknown to them, is spent in joyous dancing and storytelling, culminating in the children settling down for their favorite bedtime story, which Peter typically dislikes but chooses to stay and listen to this time.
Wendy tells a story to the children about the Darling family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Darling and their three children, including a faithful nurse dog, Nana. After being punished by Mr. Darling, the children fly off to Neverland, where they have adventures and are carefree, believing their mother will always leave their nursery window open for their return. Years later, they return home, grown up, and find the window still open, symbolizing their mother’s enduring love. However, Peter Pan experiences a painful realization that not all mothers keep the window open, as his had forgotten him and replaced him with another child. Wendy proposes taking all the lost boys back home to be adopted but is sternly reminded by Peter of his unwillingness to grow up. In the end, the children decide to leave with Wendy, but Peter stays in Neverland, determined to remain a boy forever, untouched by the pains of mature affection and responsibility.
Pirate Hook orchestrates a surprise attack on the native tribe in disregard of customary battle tactics, and despite the natives' readiness, they are caught off guard by Hook's unconventional approach. The encounter results in a heavy loss for the Piccaninny tribe, though they manage to inflict some casualties on the pirates as well. Hook's strategic ruthlessness is questioned, and his personal vendetta against Peter Pan, driven by Peter's cockiness, is highlighted. The night's violence resolves with the pirates deceiving the captured children into believing they have lost, using the sound of a tom-tom to signal false victory.
The children, including Wendy, are captured by pirates, with Peter remaining asleep, unaware of the events. Hook poisons Peter's medicine, but Tinker Bell drinks it to save him, almost dying in the process. She is revived by the belief in fairies from children Peter calls upon. Peter then sets out to rescue Wendy and the boys from the pirates, undeterred by the dangerous journey ahead.
The Jolly Roger, a notorious pirate ship, lay off Kidd's Creek. Smee, the ever-diligent but pathetic mate, worked his sewing machine on deck, while Captain Hook brooded over his triumph and personal dilemmas, such as his obsession with good form and his concealed prestigious background. Hook grappled with his success, loneliness, and an anticipated early demise, all while preparing to make the captured boys walk the plank. Tootles and the boys, true to their moral upbringing, refused to become pirates. Wendy was brought up, and even in the face of death, she inspired the boys to be brave. As the execution was about to take place, Peter Pan's ticking—signifying the feared crocodile—was heard approaching, which turned out to be Peter himself, ready to intervene.
During an adventure on the island, Peter Pan encounters a ticking-less crocodile which leads to a series of events where he uses the ticking sound to his advantage, impersonates it, and attracts the beast unknowingly. He resolves to face Captain Hook, uttering "Hook or me this time." In a confrontation aboard Hook's ship, Peter's cunning and swordsmanship ultimately lead to a battle where the Lost Boys triumph over the pirates. Hook's last stand is marked by his choice to leap into the sea, where he meets his end at the jaws of the crocodile, having been spared the knowledge of its presence. Smee and Starkey are the only pirates to escape, while Peter and the Lost Boys celebrate their victory. Wendy inspires awe in the boys with her nurturing presence both during and after the fight. The chapter ends with the children settling into sleep on the ship.
The crew aboard the ship, including Peter and Tinker Bell, prepare to return home with Peter acting as captain and maintaining strict authority. Plans for their homecoming and Wendy's reluctancy to create a pirate suit for Peter hint at deception. Back at the nursery, Mrs. Darling remains in distress over the children's absence, while Mr. Darling, feeling responsible, has taken to living in the kennel as penance. The public becomes sympathetic to his plight. Meanwhile, Peter plots to keep Wendy from reuniting with her family by closing the nursery window. However, the window is left open, allowing Wendy, John, and Michael to return home to their unsuspecting parents, who cannot initially believe the children are truly back. The family is joyously reunited, with the exception of Peter, who remains outside, barred from the familial happiness he facilitated.
Wendy and the lost boys grew up, with most becoming ordinary adults. Peter Pan remained a boy and continued his adventures, returning annually for Wendy's spring cleaning. Wendy married and had a daughter, Jane, who also meets Peter. Eventually, Peter takes Jane, and later her daughter Margaret, to Neverland for spring cleaning, perpetuating the cycle of the timeless boy and the children who grow up.
