A Wolf, feel, angry
A Wolf, declare to eat, The third Pig
A Wolf, try to get down, A chimney
The third Pig, see, A Wolf
The third Pig, hang on, A pot full of water
The third Pig, make up, A blazing fire
A Wolf, come down, A chimney
The third Pig, take off, the cover of the pot
A Wolf, fall in, A pot full of water
The third Pig, put on, the cover of the pot
The third Pig, boil up, A Wolf
The third Pig, eat, A Wolf
The third Pig, live, happy ever after
