When the Wolf came he said, "Little Pig, are you ready?" "Ready!" said the little Pig, "I have been and come back again, and got a nice pot-full for dinner." The Wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to the little Pig somehow or other; so he said, "Little Pig, I know where there is a nice apple-tree."
