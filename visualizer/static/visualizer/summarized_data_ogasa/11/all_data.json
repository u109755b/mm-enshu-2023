Alice laughs at their tangled hair but hides to avoid being heard. Approaching the house, she attempts to knock but is rebuked by the frog footman who informs her of the noisy chaos inside. After an exchange about the uselessness of knocking, Alice boldly enters the kitchen filled with smoke, where a sneezy environment caused by too much pepper affects everyone except the cook and a grinning Cheshire Cat. The Duchess nurses a baby in a violent manner and engages in brief, rude conversation with Alice before being pelted with kitchenware by the cook. Alice tries to discuss the earth's rotation, only to be interrupted by the Duchess, who abruptly leaves to prepare for croquet. Alice is left to care for the baby, which soon turns into a pig. A conversation with the Cheshire Cat leads her to contemplate going to visit the March Hare or the Hatter, as suggested by the Cat who keeps appearing and disappearing, leaving only its grin behind. The chapter ends with Alice approaching the March Hare's house ahead of deciding whether to visit there or the Hatter's abode.",

Alice is observing the absurd trial where the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing tarts. The court proceedings are nonsensical, with jurors writing down their names so they don't forget, and the Hatter is called as a witness. He gives a confused testimony, prompting the King to become impatient and threaten execution. The Hatter's evidence is incoherent, discussing his tea-time and ignoring the case. The situation becomes more chaotic as the Dormouse's comments lead to his ejection from the court. The cook is the next witness, who rudely refuses to testify, adding to the disarray. Eventually, much to Alice's surprise, she is called as the next witness.",

The Queen demands a verdict before evidence is fully heard, but Alice, now full-sized, refutes the nonsensical proceedings. The Queen orders Alice's beheading, but as the cards fly at Alice, she wakes up to find herself on the bank with her sister. It was all a dream, which she recounts to her sister before being called in for tea. Her sister stays behind, contemplating Alice's dream and dreaming herself of Alice's future growth, retaining her childlike heart and sharing her Wonderland adventures with other children.",
