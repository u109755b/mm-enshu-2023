                "summary": "Sherlock Holmes holds Irene Adler in high regard, considering her the woman who eclipses all others. Dr. Watson, narrating the story, recounts his reduced contact with Holmes after his own marriage and return to medical practice. One evening in March 1888, Watson visits Holmes, who deduces Watson's return to work and recent activities simply by observation. Holmes has received a mysterious letter summoning him to consult on a highly sensitive matter.   The client, who arrives wearing a mask and initially introduces himself as Count Von Kramm, soon reveals his true identity as the King of Bohemia. He seeks Holmes's help to retrieve a compromising photograph from Irene Adler, an opera singer with whom he had an affair. The photograph threatens his upcoming engagement to a Scandinavian princess and could potentially create a scandal. Despite previous attempts to recover or steal the photo, all have failed. Holmes takes on the case, and the King provides funds for any expenses. Holmes and Watson agree to discuss the matter further the following day.",

At Briony Lodge, they discover Adler has left England with the photo, outwitting Holmes. Despite this, the King is relieved knowing the photograph is no longer a threat, and Holmes requests the photograph of Adler as his reward. The incident demonstrates how Holmes was outsmarted by Adler, whom he now refers to with respect as \"the woman.\"",
