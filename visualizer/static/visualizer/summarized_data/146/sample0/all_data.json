        "summary": "Sara Crewe, a thoughtful and imaginative seven-year-old girl, travels with her father, Captain Crewe, through foggy London to a boarding school run by Miss Minchin. Raised in India and used to its climate and culture, Sara finds it difficult to adjust to the idea of living in England without her father, as children in India are often sent to England for education due to the harsh climate. Sara, who doesn't relate to other children her age and prefers books, is to become a parlor boarder with special privileges. Despite being precocious and mature for her age, Sara is humble and doesn't consider herself beautiful. During her stay with her father in a hotel, they purchase luxurious clothes and a doll, Emily, to serve as her companion after Captain Crewe leaves for India. Sara's unique outlook and old-fashioned demeanor impress Miss Minchin, though the headmistress is largely motivated by the wealth and status the girl brings. After spending lavishly on Sara, her father departs, entrusting her to Miss Minchin's care, believing his solicitors will manage the financial aspects. They say an emotional goodbye, and Sara locks herself in her room to grieve in solitude, while Miss Minchin anticipates displaying Sara's finery during school outings.",

Miss Minchin privately dislikes Sara but tolerates her behavior to keep her as a pupil. Despite her indulgences, Sara is self-aware and often contemplates whether her good nature is genuine or a product of her favorable circumstances. Sara's classmate Lavinia, once the school's leader, grows jealous of Sara, who is naturally admired and never acts superior despite her advantages.  Sara's kindness is evident in her relationships with the younger students, particularly Lottie, a temperamental child who has lost her mother. When Lottie causes a scene at school, Sara manages to calm her down by offering to be a motherly figure to her and distract her with imaginative stories of heaven. Her approach transforms Lottie's behavior, and Sara becomes an adoptive mother to the little girl, demonstrating her inherent generosity and empathy.",

At school, this news stirs various reactions; Sara is enchanted, weaving tales of the mines for her friends, while Lavinia skeptically dismisses such wealth as implausible. An incident involving Lottie's minor injury in the schoolroom demonstrates Sara's caring nature. Sara is called \"Princess Sara\" both mockingly and affectionately by her schoolmates. Meanwhile, Sara befriends Becky, the scullery maid, sharing food and stories, making Becky's hard life a bit happier. Sara's loving and giving nature touches Becky deeply, with even small acts of kindness making a significant impact. Sara's eleventh birthday is anticipated with great excitement due to elaborate preparations by her father. However, Captain Crewe is feeling the pressure of his business troubles. The schoolroom is decked out for a grand celebration, and Sara receives a handmade present from Becky, which touches her heart. Becky uses a discarded card from Miss Amelia for the gift, showing her earnest desire to give Sara a proper present. Sara's response is one of grateful affection for Becky's thoughtful gesture.",

Though richer and admired in the past, she now endures poverty and neglect, going on errands in shabby clothes, feeling excluded from the world bustling around her. She finds solace in observing a cheerful family she nicknames \"the Large Family,\" whom she envisions as having romantic, literary names. One evening, Guy Clarence from the Large Family mistakes Sara for a beggar and offers her a sixpence, which she reluctantly accepts, and afterward, the Large Family comes to regard her as \"The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar.\" Despite her hardships, she finds affection with the school's little ones, talking to birds and a rat named Melchisedec, and even pretends her doll Emily has feelings, until one night, overwhelmed by her situation, she lashes out at Emily, before resigning to the reality that Emily can't feel. Meanwhile, the vacant house next door is taken by a rich Indian gentleman, who is unwell and has a mysterious link to the father of the Large Family. The arrival of this new neighbor sets off a wave of speculation and potential excitement for Sara.",

One evening, after a vibrant sunset, Sara encounters Ram Dass, an Indian servant, and his monkey.

She considers him a friend and sympathizes deeply with his troubles, which include a severe illness and past misfortunes involving his wealth and mines. Ermengarde and Sara discuss their lack of affection for their own relatives, contrasting that with the fondness one can feel for strangers. The Indian gentleman, Mr. Carrisford, grapples with guilt over losing his friend Crewe's fortune, which he later recuperated. He's haunted by the unknown fate of Crewe's daughter, whom he desperately wishes to find. As he confides in Mr. Carmichael, Sara simultaneously experiences her own struggles with hardship and retains kindness despite her challenges. Both on their respective sides of the wall, Sara and Mr. Carrisford yearn for connection and resolution to their worries.",

Despite this, her spirit remains unbroken, and she takes solace in a visit from her friend Ermengarde and the company of the attic's rat, Melchisedec.  Sara narrates stories to Ermengarde, promising to help her with her lessons. They share a moment of fantasy about being royalty, contrasting their grim reality. Their night is brightened when Ermengarde brings a hamper of delicious food, and they share a celebratory feast, including Becky, a servant girl. They are, however, caught by the furious Miss Minchin, who punishes all involved.  Left alone, Sara confronts both her hunger and the loss of the feast. She falls asleep hungry and awakens to a transformed attic with a warm fire, a feast, and a note from a mysterious friend, convincing her that magic has intervened to care for her in her time of need. She shares this newfound joy with Becky, reassuring her that their suffering has been alleviated by this unexpected miracle.",

Mr. Carrisford is concerned because the friend who lost Crewe's money is actually him, and he is guilt-ridden. When Mr. Carmichael returns, he reports that the child found in Moscow is not Crewe's daughter. As they consider searching London schools, Sara Crewe, the child next door Mr. Carrisford has been unknowingly assisting, returns his pet monkey. After revealing that she was born in India and is now a mistreated drudge at Miss Minchin's, Mr. Carrisford realizes she is the lost child they are seeking.
