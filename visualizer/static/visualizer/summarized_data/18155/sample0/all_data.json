The second pig builds a furze house with a similar fate. The third pig builds a brick house, which the wolf can\u2019t blow down. The pig repeatedly outsmarts the wolf's attempts to catch him and eventually kills the wolf by tricking him into falling into a pot of boiling water, ensuring the pig's survival and happiness.",
